abstract: Purpose of the review:To assess the most recent high-quality evidence for endometrial cancer prevention strategies.Recent findings:Obesity is an established risk factor for endometrial cancer. Weight cycling and weight gain in middle age are risk factors for endometrial cancer. Bariatric surgery reduces the risk of endometrial cancer by up to 81% in obese women who attain and maintain a normal weight. Combined oral contraceptives provide durable protection against endometrial cancer for 30 years or more. Ever use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and inert intrauterine devices reduce endometrial cancer risk. The first oestrogen-based non-progestin HRT for non-hysterectomised women that contains estradiol and bazedoxifene has an effective protective effect on endometrium. Bisphosphonates reduce endometrial cancer risk. Weight loss and LNG-IUS would seem to be an effective strategy for preventing the development of obesity-driven endometrial cancer in the highest risk women. Future research may identify other safe and effective chemoprevention interventions, such as aspirin, bisphosphonates or metformin.
