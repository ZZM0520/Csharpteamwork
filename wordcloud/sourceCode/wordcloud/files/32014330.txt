abstract: For over forty years, the Gynecologic Oncology Group drove progress in treating endometrial cancer. The first decades of investigation began with a meticulous prospective, surgicopathologic staging study that was the platform for development of all subsequent trials. The resultant statistical model of low risk, intermediate risk, and high-risk groups of patients led to trials where therapeutic modalities were best targeted at disease spread. A clear role for chemotherapy was established. It was realized that greater advances might be achieved with the advent of newer anti-neoplastic agents and these agents were subjected to extensive phase II testing. These agents later were integrated into comparison trials for advanced endometrial cancer. Multimodality therapy continues to show promise. Hormonal therapy was thoroughly investigated and led to combination hormonal therapy trials. Newer agents, including biologics are under active study, as well as the potential contribution of modern imaging techniques. Finally, GOG0210 established a repository of clinical specimens with detailed clinical and epidemiologic data from patients with surgically staged endometrial carcinoma. This should provide for a much greater understanding of molecular characteristics associated with risk of endometrial cancer recurrence, clinical and histological characteristics, and epidemiologic factors.
