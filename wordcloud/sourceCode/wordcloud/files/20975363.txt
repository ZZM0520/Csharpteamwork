abstract: The indications for adjuvant therapy in endometrial cancer are briefly reviewed. The importance of systemic adjuvant therapy is emphasized. A short summary of randomized studies on adjuvant chemotherapy versus radiotherapy and on adjuvant sequential chemotherapy plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone is given. On the basis of the present results from randomized trials, a combination of adjuvant radiotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy seems to be most effective.
