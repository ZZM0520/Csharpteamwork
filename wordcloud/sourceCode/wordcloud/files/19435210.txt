abstract: Sixty-six peri- or postmenopausal patients with endometrial pathology were treated and followed-up. Ultrasound, color Doppler examination and energy mapping of uterine intra-tumor vessels were used. Endometrial carcinoma was diagnosed in 52 (78.8%), mean age 65.4 +/- 7.0. Ultrasound angiography is instrumental in such diagnosis as it registers peculiarities of intra-organ and tumor-related features. It contributes to improvement of diagnosis and to efficacy of antitumor therapy monitoring.
