abstract: Background:Prognostic clinicopathological factors for type 1 endometrial cancer are unknown and the purpose of the current study was to determine the independent prognostic variables for type 1 endometrial cancer.Methods:We performed a retrospective study of 168 patients with type 1 endometrial cancer primarily treated with comprehensive staging surgery. The median follow-up time was 68 (12-100) months. Independent risk factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined using multivariate Cox regression models. Sub-group analysis of stage I was also performed. We also assessed the patterns of failure among patients with recurrences and investigated the associations with the prognostic variables determined by multivariate analysis.Results:Twenty patients (11.9%) had recurrence and 13 patients (7.7%) died of the disease overall. Multivariate analysis revealed that grade 2 (G2) histology (p = 0.008) and positive peritoneal cytology (p = 0.001) predicted the recurrent event in type 1 endometrial cancer. G2 histology (p = 0.007) and positive peritoneal cytology (p = 0.003) were also found to be independent risk factors for tumor-related deaths. Among stage I patients, G2 histology and positive peritoneal cytology were also independent prognostic variables for DFS and OS. Patients with G2 histology and/or positive peritoneal cytology were more likely to have recurrence at distant sites.Conclusions:G2 histology and positive peritoneal cytology were independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS in type 1 endometrial cancer.
