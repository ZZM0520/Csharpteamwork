abstract: Objective:The aim of this study was to validate the role of the new FIGO staging system for estimating prognosis for patients with stage IIIC endometrial cancer.Methods:A total of 93 cases with stage IIIC were entered in this study and classified into three groups: one group of patients who underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLX) and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PALX) and who were for positive for pelvic node metastasis (PLNM) and negative for para-aortic node metastasis (PANM) (Group 1), one group of patients who underwent PLX alone and were positive for PLNM (Group 2) and one group of patients who underwent PLX and PALX and were positive for PANM (Group 3). Information on clinicopathologic findings and treatments was obtained from medical charts. Cox regression analysis was used to select prognostic factors.Results:The 5-years survival rates were 89.3% in Group 1, 46.5% in Group 2 and 59.9% in Group 3. The overall survival rate in Group 1 was significantly better than that in Group 2 (p=0.0001) and Group 3 (p=0.0016). No significant difference in overall survival was found between Group 2 and Group 3. Age, number of metastatic lymph nodes, type of lymphadenectomy and type of adjuvant therapy were significantly and independently related to overall survival. Only when patients received PALX, PANM was a prognostic risk factor.Conclusion:Sub-classification of stage IIIC would be functional for estimating prognosis in the revised FIGO staging system. Systematic lymphadenectomy including PALX has therapeutic significance for patients with stage IIIC endometrial cancer. Prognosis of patients with stage IIIC endometrial cancer would depend much more on application of lymphadenectomy including PALX than nodal status.
