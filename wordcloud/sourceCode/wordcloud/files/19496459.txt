abstract: Aim:We tried to summarise our and foreign experience in the modern treatment of endometrial cancer.Material and methods:We evaluated for 10 years period 400 patients treated surgically, as well as treated with postoperative radiotherapy. We tried to give the allgorhythm for treatment of this kind of cancer. All patients with grading 3 tumors, serous-papillary and clear cell endometrial cancers are obligatory are staged surgically. In some of our patients we performed pelvic lymph node dissection with or without paraaortal dissection which brought a more precise information.Results:In patients with pelvic and paraaortal lymph node dissection (200) we had significantly better overall survival rate (p = 0.0003), as well as better survival rate both in low risky and high risky groups (low risky groups p = 0.028, high risky groups p = 0.0007).Conclusions:The therapeutic benefit of this method is in resecting of the enlarged, positive lymph nodes, which can not be sterilized with radiotherapy. The postoperative intravaginal and percutaneous radiotherapy save these patients from vaginal recurrences.
