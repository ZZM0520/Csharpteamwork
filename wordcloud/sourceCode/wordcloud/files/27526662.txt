abstract: Aim:During routine follow-up for postoperative endometrial cancer, we have encountered patients with and without symptoms at recurrence. In this study, we investigated whether or not there is a difference in the prognosis between patients with and without symptoms at recurrence.Methods:We reviewed endometrial cancer patients who had been treated in our hospital between 1998 and 2007. Routine follow-up was conducted by our facility criteria. We investigated recurrence-free survival (RFS), presence or absence of symptoms at recurrence, overall survival from recurrence (OSFR), and overall survival (OS).Results:The subjects were 293 patients. Recurrence was detected in 46 patients. The median RFS was 15 (1-103) months. At the time of recurrence, symptoms were present in 14 patients and absent in 32 patients. In groups with and without symptoms at recurrence, the median OSFR were 36 (2-100) and 45 (2-139) months, respectively. The median OS were 55 (6-163) and 100 (11-178) months, respectively. There were no significant differences in either parameter. Independent prognostic factors for OSFR and OS were histopathologic types other than endometrioid carcinoma (vs endometrioid carcinoma, hazard ratio = 3.102 and 3.008, respectively) and RFS of 14 months or shorter (vs 15 months or longer, hazard ratio = 2.378 and 3.739, respectively).Conclusion:There was no difference in the prognosis between the groups with and without symptoms at recurrence. Independent prognostic factors of recurrent patients were histopathologic types and RFS. A large-scale study should be conducted to examine the necessity of routine follow-up for detecting recurrence in the absence of symptoms.
