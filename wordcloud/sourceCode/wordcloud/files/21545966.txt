abstract: Data are limited regarding the occurrence of endometrial cancer after endometrial ablation (EA). A systematic review of the English-language medical literature was performed of cases of endometrial cancer after EA. This review included the present case report involving a 47-year-old woman with a diagnosis of stage IA, grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma 5 years after radiofrequency EA. The systematic literature review identified 22 endometrial cancer cases occurring after EA. Most (76.5%) were stage I at diagnosis. Time to endometrial cancer diagnosis ranged from 2 weeks to 10 years following EA. All but 3 cases involved patients with known endometrial cancer risk factors. To our knowledge, the present case is the first reported occurrence of endometrial cancer after radiofrequency EA. Endometrial cancer has been detected after EA at variable intervals. Occurrence of endometrial cancer after EA is low, yet it continues to be difficult to quantify through retrospective analyses.
