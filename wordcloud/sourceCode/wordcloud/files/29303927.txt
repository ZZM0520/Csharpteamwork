abstract: Background:Lymph node status is one of the most important prognostic factors in endometrial cancer and crucial for deciding adjuvant therapy.Objective:The aim of the study was to assess the different models used to predict lymphatic nodal disease.Search strategy:A literature search was conducted to detect the relevant studies.Inclusion criteria:Relevant papers comparing the preoperative modality with the final histopathological results including randomized clinical trials, case-control studies, and any publications with a minimum of 50 patients in the report.Results:Molecular-based predictors are still far from a practical application. Preoperative radiological scans (positron emission tomography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound) have shown the best predictor of lymphatic dissemination. However, there is currently no ideal model available, which can be used within standard clinical care.Conclusions:Surgical staging still remains the criterion standard in the determination of lymph node status in endometrial cancer.
