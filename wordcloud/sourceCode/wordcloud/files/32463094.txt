abstract: Endometrial cancer frequently occurs in post-menopausal women, and the endometrium is a well-known site of cancer affecting women. Endometrial cancer is found with genital bleeding and often at an early stage. However, there are some risks of recurrence after hysterectomy. As a medical treatment after the diagnosis of endometrial cancer, appropriate adjuvant therapy is considered to lead to a decrease in the rate of recurrence and improvement of prognosis according to the determination of the cancer stage from the surgical and histopathological results. In this review, we describe post-operative adjuvant therapy administered for endometrial cancer and advanced disease, focusing on chemotherapy, radiation therapy and the combination of both. These treatments are divided according to the risk of recurrence as based primarily on the reported evidence.
