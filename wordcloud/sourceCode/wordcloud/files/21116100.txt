abstract: In this report we update our long-term follow-up results of the prospective study whose aim was to evaluate the efficacy of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in combination with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in the treatment of medically inoperable endometrial cancer. Between 1995 and 1998, 29 patients with stages I-III medically inoperable carcinoma of endometrium were treated with definitive irradiation. All patients underwent combined intracavitary HDR brachytherapy and EBRT. The EBRT dose was 50 Gy with midline shield from 16 Gy. The HDR brachytherapy dose was 50 Gy, delivered in 5 fractions in a weekly schedule. Overall survival (OS) at 5 and 10 years was 48.3% and 20.7%, respectively. Disease-specific survival (DSS) at 5 and 10 years was 73.5% and 67.9%, respectively. The 10-year DSS rate was 73.5% for all stages, 85.7% for Stage I disease, 71.4% for Stage II, and 16.7% for stage III disease. Late Grade 1-2 radiation complications were observed in 4 patients (13.8%). Our long-term follow-up confirms that HDR brachytherapy with EBRT appears to be an effective and safe treatment for stage I and II medically inoperable endometrial cancer.
