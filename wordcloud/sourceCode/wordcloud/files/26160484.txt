abstract: Objective:This study evaluates the association between serum adiponectin concentrations and the risk of endometrial cancer through a comprehensive meta-analysis of currently available clinical data.Methods:PubMed, Embase, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and the Science Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) were searched for studies that examined the association between blood adiponectin concentrations and the risk of endometrial cancer. Data from studies that met the inclusion criteria were systematically reviewed, and pooled analyses were performed according to the guidelines of Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and PRIMSA.Results:Eight case-control studies (including 1257 endometrial cancer patients and 2008 controls) and four nested case-control studies (including 659 endometrial cancer patients and 1398 controls) were included. We found that serum adiponectin level was inversely correlated with the risk of endometrial cancer development after pooling the case-control studies (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.60; P &lt; 0.001). However, meta-analysis of nested case-control studies thus far did not support a broad linkage between serum adiponectin level and endometrial cancer, although a correlation may exist in the subgroup of postmenopausal women (OR=0.81, 95%CI: 0.65-1.00; P=0.060), particularly in postmenopausal women without current hormone replacement therapy (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44-0.86; P = 0.004).Conclusions:Meta-analysis of currently available clinical evidence supports the association between high serum adiponectin concentration and reduced risk of endometrial cancer development, particularly in the group of postmenopausal women without current hormone replacement therapy. However, additional studies with prospective design are required to fully support this linkage.
