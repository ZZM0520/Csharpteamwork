abstract: Endometrial cancer is highly malignant and has a poor prognosis in the advanced stage, thus, prediction of its prognosis is important. DNA methylation has rapidly gained clinical attention as a biomarker for diagnostic, prognostic and predictive purposes in various cancers. In present study, differentially methylated positions and differentially expressed genes were identified according to DNA methylation and RNA-Seq data. Functional analyses and interaction network were performed to identify hub genes, and overall survival analysis of hub genes were validated. The top genes were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of endometrial cancer tissues. The gene function was evaluated by cell growth curve after knockdown CDC20 and CCNA2 of endometrial cancer cell line. A total of 329 hypomethylated highly expressed genes and 359 hypermethylated lowly expressed genes were identified, and four hub genes were obtained according to the interaction network. Patients with low expression of CDC20 and CCNA2 showed better overall survival. The results also were demonstrated by the immunohistochemical staining. Cell growth curve also demonstrated that knockdown CDC20 and CCNA2 can suppress the cell proliferation. We have identified two aberrantly methylated genes, CDC20 and CCNA2 as novel biomarkers for precision diagnosis in EC.
