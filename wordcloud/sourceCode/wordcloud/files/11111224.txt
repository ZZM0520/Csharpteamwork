title=Endometrial cancer in elderly women: A histologic and steroid receptor study.

time=2000 Jan-Feb
abstract: Background:Information on steroid receptor content in endometrial tissue of aging women is limited and somewhat controversial. The high incidence of endometrial cancer (EC) and the implication of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in this group prompted the investigation of steroid receptors and endometrial cancer histology in the elderly.Objective:Review of histologic characteristics correlated with estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) status in EC in women over 75 years of age in order to determine the prevalence of a more aggressive endometrial neoplasm arising in late postmenopausal atrophic endometrium of elderly patients.Methods:Histologic slides and deeper sections stained immunohistologically for ER/PR from 54 cases of EC in women aged 75-95 years were reviewed. The histologic characteristics and degree of differentiation were correlated with the steroid receptor status, evaluated on a scale of 0-3. Benign endometrial tissue from women of the same group was used as controls.Results:The 57.4% endometrioid adenocarcinomas were mostly moderately and poorly differentiated. The nonendometrioid carcinomas were anaplastic, papillary, clear cell, squamous cell, mixed m√ºllerian and nongestational choriocarcinoma. The staining intensity for ER/PR decreased with the degree of dedifferentiation being weak or absent in nonendometrioid tumors.Conclusion:Elderly patients have less differentiated EC displaying histologically nonendometrioid patterns ('alienation') with no differential loss of receptors in cancer. ER/PR are partly preserved in endometrioid tumors and controls. We conclude that differential loss of receptor capacity is not a factor in pathogenesis of this age-related cancer.
