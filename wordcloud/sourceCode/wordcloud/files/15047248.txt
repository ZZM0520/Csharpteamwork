abstract: Background:The incidence of isolated aortic nodal metastasis in clinical stages I and II endometrial cancer is generally low. Nevertheless, para-aortic nodes are still assessed during staging procedures, which include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling up to the level of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The procedure can be performed either abdominally or laparoscopically. It is unclear, however, as to whether infrarenal aortic nodal sampling above the IMA should be routinely performed.Case:We describe a case of endometrial cancer metastatic to the infrarenal para-aortic lymph nodes above the IMA, missed during laparoscopic inframesenteric lymph node dissection, and found on subsequent laparotomy performed to resect matted pelvic nodes.Conclusions:The infrarenal para-aortic region above the IMA may be at risk for nodal metastasis in women with endometrial cancer. Consideration should be given to evaluate this area during staging laparotomy or laparoscopy. The role of routine bilateral infrarenal aortic nodal dissection needs further evaluation.
