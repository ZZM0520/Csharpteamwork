abstract: Preoperative examination of a patient for whom a diagnosis of endometrial cancer has been made by office biopsy or dilatation and curettage includes careful history taking and physical examination, with emphasis on the pelvic examination, blood tests, and imaging evaluations of the pelvis, abdomen and chest, and other specific studies related to medical operability. The primary approach to endometrial cancer is surgery, which has been used for staging and treatment since the adoption of the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology system in 1988. Pilot studies and the Gynecologic Oncology Group have researched this system extensively and have emphasized the findings that could be defined only by pathologic study of the uterus, adnexa, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and peritoneal cytologic findings. Preoperative endocervical evaluation is no longer necessary unless gross invasion of the cervix is suspected. However, initial histologic findings can identify patients at high risk, that is, those with high grade adenocarcinomas, clear cell carcinomas, adenosquamous carcinomas, and papillary serous adenocarcinomas. Intraoperative pathologic evaluation of the uterus by frozen section, which reveals depth of invasion into the myometrium and correlation with tumor grade, can identify patients for whom lymph node sampling should be performed.
