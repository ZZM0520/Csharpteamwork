abstract: The aim of the present study is to analyze the patients with endometrial cancer, treated at Gynecology Clinic of the National Oncology Hospital, Sofia according to the stage of the disease, histological type, differentiation, the peculiarities of the spreading and metastases, the therapeutic methods applied and the obtained results. For the period 2002-2004, 152 women with endometrial cancer were treated at the clinic. Predominate the patients with first stage cancer 117 (77%) and with endometroid adenocarcinoma/adenoacantoma 116 (76.3%), as well as these who were treated with surgery 134 (88.2%), followed by radio, hormonotherapy. Among the surgical procedures the simple total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoophorectomy was the most frequent applied method - 119 (79.2%) patients, followed by radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoophorectomy and lymph node dissection 25 (16.7%). At the end of the 3 years study period 118 (77.6%) women are alive and 34 (22.4%) are dead. For 28 (18.5%) patients the reason for the death was the oncological disease and for 6 (3.9%)--other type of disease. Our results demonstrate once again, that therapeutic success of patients with endometrial cancer depends directly of the exact determination of the prognostic factors and administration of complex approach in the treatment of every patient.
