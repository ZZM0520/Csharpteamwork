abstract: Aim:The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors for recurrence in patients with low-risk endometrial cancer (EC).Patients and methods:This retrospective study was performed using 10 gynecological oncology department databases. Patients who met the following criteria were included in the study: (a) endometrioid-type histology, (b) histological grade 1 or 2, (c) no or &lt; 50% myometrial invasion, (d) no intraoperative evidence of extrauterine spread, and (e) the patient underwent at least a pelvic lymphadenectomy. Recurrence was detected in 56 patients who were histologically diagnosed with low-risk EC, and these patients made up the case group. A total of 224 patients with low-risk EC without recurrence were selected (control group) using a dependent random sampling method. The case and control groups were match-paired in terms of grade, stage, and operative technique.Results:Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (odds ratio (OR) 5.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-16.9; p = 0.001) and primary tumor diameter (PTD) ≥ 20 mm (OR 6.6, 95% CI 2.7-15.8; p &lt; 0.001) were found to be independent risk factors for recurrence in women with low-risk EC.Conclusion:The presence of LVSI and PTD ≥ 20 mm seem to be significant risk factors for recurrence in women with low-risk EC.
