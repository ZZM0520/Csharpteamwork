abstract: Objectives:There is a lack of circulating markers to predict disease outcome, therapy effect and monitoring for disease recurrence in endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was to explore whether plasma concentration of the inflammatory marker calprotectin is elevated in endometrial cancer and related to clinical parameters.Methods:Calprotectin in EDTA-plasma samples from women with primary endometrial carcinoma (n=194), from healthy premenopausal (n=20) and postmenopausal (n=20) women was analyzed with ELISA.Results:Median plasma calprotectin concentration was elevated in the patient group of endometrial cancer (3415 microg/L) as compared to the healthy premenopausal (832 microg/L) and postmenopausal groups (868 microg/L), both p&lt;0.001. Also, median calprotectin concentration was elevated in the endometrial cancer group as compared to women with invasive ovarian cancer, borderline ovarian tumor and benign ovarian tumors. Calprotectin plasma concentration correlated significantly with poor survival and high FIGO stage in endometrial carcinoma.Conclusion:Calprotectin is elevated in plasma of women with endometrial carcinoma. Further studies are warranted to assess its possible value as a clinical tool for evaluating disease progression and relapse, as well as in monitoring treatment response.
