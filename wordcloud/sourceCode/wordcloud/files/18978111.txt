abstract: Objective:To evaluate whether a prolonged time interval between dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) and hysterectomy has an effect on survival in patients with surgically treated endometrial cancer.Methods:In this multicenter study, time between D&amp;C and hysterectomy was correlated to clinical data in 344 surgically staged patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer.Results:The median (interquartile range) interval between D&amp;C and hysterectomy in patients with endometrial cancer was 23 (13-34) days. In a univariable survival analysis, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) tumor stage (P&lt;.001, P&lt;.001), tumor grade (P&lt;.001, P&lt;.001), and patients' age (P&lt;.001, P&lt;.001), but not time interval from D&amp;C to hysterectomy (P=.06, P=.07) were associated with disease-free and overall survival, respectively. In a multivariable Cox regression model, FIGO tumor stage (P&lt;.001, P&lt;.001), and patients' age (P&lt;.001, P&lt;.001) but not tumor grade (P=.4, P=.2) or time interval between D&amp;C and hysterectomy (P=.5, P=.8) were independent prognostic factors for disease-free and overall survival, respectively.Conclusion:We were not able to show that a prolonged time interval between D&amp;C and hysterectomy has a significant effect on the prognosis of patients with endometrial cancer.Level of evidence:II.
