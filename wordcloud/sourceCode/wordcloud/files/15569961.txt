abstract: Objective:We evaluated the association between socioeconomic status and racial/ ethnic differences in endometrial cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment, and survival.Methods:We conducted a population-based study among 3656 women.Results:Multivariate analyses showed that either race/ethnicity or income, but not both, was associated with advanced-stage disease. Age, stage at diagnosis, and income were independent predictors of hysterectomy. African American ethnicity, increased age, aggressive histology, poor tumor grade, and advanced-stage disease were associated with increased risk for death; higher income and hysterectomy were associated with decreased risk for death.Conclusions:Lower income was associated with advanced-stage disease, lower likelihood of receiving a hysterectomy, and lower rates of survival. Earlier diagnosis and removal of barriers to optimal treatment among lower-socioeconomic status women will diminish racial/ethnic differences in endometrial cancer survival.
