abstract: Rationale, aims and objectives:We evaluated the adherence to treatment guidelines in early stage endometrial cancer and the influence of adherence to guidelines on overall survival.Method:Patients were identified in the central region in the Netherlands from 1990 till 1995. Patient and tumour characteristics, surgical findings, radiation and follow-up data were abstracted from medical records. Endpoint was overall survival. Kaplan-Meier method was used to perform time-to-event analysis. Hazard ratios for overall survival were estimated with a Cox Proportional Hazards model.Results:359 patients were eligible for analysis. 335 patients presented with a clinical stage I cancer. 333 patients underwent a Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo Oophorectomy (TAH/BSO), of which 301 were staged as International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, whereas 34 (10.2%) as FIGO stage II. Of the 24 patients with a clinical stage II cancer, 12 underwent a Radical Hysterectomy with Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection (RH/PLND), of which seven were diagnosed with FIGO stage II. In 72.1% of the patients adjuvant radiation was given or not in adherence to the guidelines. Whether treatment was given according to the guidelines or not did not affect 5 years overall survival.Conclusion:This suggests that extensive surgical procedures are redundant in the treatment of occult stage II endometrial cancer.
