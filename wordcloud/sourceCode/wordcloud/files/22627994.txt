abstract: Purpose:Since 2009 the new FIGO Staging System of endometrial cancer, which changed the previous FIGO 1988 Staging System, has been in use. The aim of the study was to compare prognosis in patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer at stage IB of the 2009 FIGO Staging System and of the 1988 FIGO Staging System.Methods:We analyzed 173 patients: 108 patients (group A) at stage IB in FIGO 1988 Staging System, and 68 patients (group B) at stage IB in FIGO 2009 Staging System from 262 consecutive endometrioid endometrial cancer patients. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between these groups.Results:The DFS rate was 96.3 % in group A and it was 87.7 % in group B (p = 0.029). Relapses were observed in 12 patients (6.4 %) from 6 to 57 months (mean 28.1; SD = 14.6) after initial surgery, and occurred in four patients from group A (3.7 %) and eight patients from group B (12.3 %) (p = 0.032). The OS rate was 94.4 % in group A and it was 83.1 % in group B (p = 0.018). During follow-up, 17 patients (9.8 %) died: six patients from group A (5.6 %), and 11 patients from group B (16.9 %).Conclusions:Stage IB in FIGO 2009 Staging System is associated with worse prognosis compared to stage IB according to FIGO 1988 classification. There seems to be a need to use exclusively the new FIGO 2009 classification worldwide to avoid therapeutic mistakes, which can be caused by diverse nomenclature.
