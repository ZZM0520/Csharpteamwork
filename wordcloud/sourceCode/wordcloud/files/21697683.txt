abstract: Introduction:Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in France, with more than 6500 new cases in 2010. The French National Cancer Institute has been leading a clinical practice guidelines (CPG) project since 2008. This project involves the development and updating of evidence-based CPG in oncology.Objective:To develop CPG for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for patients with endometrial cancer.Methods:The guideline development process is based on systematic literature review and critical appraisal by experts, with feedback from specialists in cancer care delivery. The recommendations are thus based on the best available evidence and expert agreement.Results:Main recommendations include a routine pelvic magnetic resonance imaging in association with magnetic resonance imaging exploration of the para-aortic lymph nodes for locoregional staging, surgical treatment based on total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without lymphadenectomy, and clinical examination for the follow-up. The initial laparoscopic surgical approach is recommended for stage I tumors. Lymphadenectomy and postoperative external radiotherapy are recommended for patients with high risk of recurrence but are restricted for patients with low or intermediate risk. If brachytherapy is indicated, it should be given at a high-dose rate rather than a low-dose rate. Routine imaging, biologic tests, and vaginal smears are not indicated for follow-up.
