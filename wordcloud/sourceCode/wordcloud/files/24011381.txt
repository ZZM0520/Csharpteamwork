abstract: Objective:Hypoalbuminemia, a known marker for malnutrition and increased morbidity and mortality, has been associated with impaired prognosis in different cancer entities. The present study investigates the prognostic value of pre-treatment serum albumin levels for survival in patients with endometrial cancer.Study design:Within the present cohort study, we evaluated 337 consecutive patients with endometrial cancer and investigated the association of pre-treatment serum albumin levels and clinical-pathological parameters. We performed univariate log-rank tests and multivariable Cox regression models to assess the association between pre-treatment serum albumin levels and survival.Results:Pre-treatment serum albumin levels were inversely proportionally associated with FIGO tumor stage, histological grade, and patients' age. In a multivariable analysis pre-treatment serum albumin levels (p = 0.02 and p = 0.001), FIGO tumor stage (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001), and histological grade (p = 0.002 and p &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with disease-free and progression-free survival, respectively.Conclusion:Pre-treatment serum albumin is a novel and independent prognostic parameter for disease-free and progression-free survival in patients with endometrial cancer.
