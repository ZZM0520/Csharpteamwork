abstract: Aims:Controversial issues with respect to the treatment of patients with endometrial cancer include indications for lymphadenectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy.Patient and methods:Between 1998 and 2004 all women with endometrial cancer stage I were included (n = 335). They all underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-o√∂phorectomy. Two hundred and thirty-seven women also had a pelvic lymphadenectomy. When pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed, radiotherapy was administered only to patients with lymph-node metastases. Otherwise, adjuvant radiotherapy was based on the presence of risk factors.Results:Eleven patients had lymph-node metastases. The overall absolute and relative survival-estimate at 5 years was 85.0 and 93.7%, respectively. Loco-regional recurrence was 8.5%. In the group with pelvic lymphadenectomy and negative lymph nodes these rates were 88.2, 93.9 and 5.6%, respectively. In 58 patients without any of the risk factors tumour grade III, deep myometrial invasion, or age &gt; or =60 years, no lymph-node metastases were found.Conclusion:In patients with endometrial cancer FIGO stage I without risk-factors, a phenomenon which occurs in about 25% of patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer, a lymphadenectomy can be omitted. In other patients, the debate regarding the optimal treatment will remain.
