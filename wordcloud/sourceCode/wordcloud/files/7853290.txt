title=Endometrial cancer in a double uterus. A report of two cases.
from:J Reprod Med
time=1994 Nov
abstract: Two cases of double uteri associated with endometrial adenocarcinoma are presented. A correct diagnosis in this situation may be difficult to make due to anatomic difficulties or the unrecognized presence of a second uterine cavity. Ultrasound imaging should be considered to look for a second uterine cavity after a negative endometrial biopsy when clinically suspecting endometrial cancer.
