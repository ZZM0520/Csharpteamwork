abstract: Objective:To investigate the prognostic factors of surgery-pathological stage III endometrial cancer.Method:The clinical data of 102 patients with stage III endometrial cancer, aged 54.9 (27-79), 71 with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 31 with non-endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 9 undergoing simple surgical treatment, and 42 receiving radiation, 16 receiving chemotherapy, and 35 receiving chemoradiation after surgery, were analyzed retrospectively. Follow-up was conducted for 56 (3-192) months.Results:Cox risk model analysis showed that the risk factors for the prognosis of stage III endometrial cancer were pathological types, method of treatment, vascular thrombosis, and age (all P &lt; 0.05). The average survival time of stage III a endometrial cancer patients purely positive in peritoneal cytology was 74.4 months, significantly longer than that of the patients with serosa and/or annex involvement (53.8 months, P &lt; 0.05).Conclusion:The independent prognostic factors of stage III endometrial cancer are pathological type, method of treatment, vascular thrombosis, and age. The patients with, the prognosis of stage III a endometrial cancer simply positive in peritoneal cytology is better than that with serous and/or annex involvement.
