abstract: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer and the sixth most common cancer among women in Taiwan. Risk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity, long-term estrogen replacement therapy, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, nulliparty, early age at menarche, late age at menopause, and tamoxifen therapy. Most women with endometrial cancer exhibit abnormal uterine bleeding. Endometrial cancer is often diagnosed at stage I. Surgery alone is the primary treatment for stage I endometrial cancer. Fortunately, mortality rates for endometrial cancer are relatively low, with a 5-year survival rate of 81% among women who are diagnosed with endometrial cancer in Taiwan. However, the common side effects of treatment, including infertility, surgical menopause, lymphedema of the lower extremities, sexual dysfunction, distress, and fatigue, impact significantly on the quality of life of patients. Lifestyle changes such as keeping physically active and eating a diet that is high in fruit and vegetables may alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life in women who have undergone treatment for endometrial cancer.
