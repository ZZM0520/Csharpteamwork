abstract: We have produced a monoclonal antibody (MSN-1), by using our endometrial cancer-cultured cell line (SNG-II) as an immunogen. MSN-1 belongs to the IgM immunoglobulin class and mainly recognized the Lewis carbohydrate moiety. It seldom, reacted immunohistochemically with normal endometrium but with about 90% of endometrial cancer cases. So, we evaluated the effectiveness of its use in clinical application. We studied the relationship between the stage of cancer and reactivity to MSN-1, and that between the reactivity of moderately differentiated endometrial cancer to MSN-1 and a 5-year survival rate. Endometrial cancer with a poor prognosis tended to react poorly to MSN-1, suggesting the possibility that the reactivity to MSN-1 is useful as a new prognostic factor. A study of endometrial hyperplasia revealed that the reactivity to MSN-1 was high in the high risk group (individuals diagnosed as endometrial cancer later). This suggested that the analysis of the expression of the antigen recognized by MSN-1 is useful in selecting the high risk group out of patients with endometrial hyperplasia. Furthermore, we indicated that abnormal expression of the antigen recognized by MSN-1 associated with neoplasia of endometrial cells is useful in developing a new diagnostic method for example our endometrial cell enzyme immunoassay (EmC-EIA) and will be helpful in developing diagnostic approaches, such as missile therapy with a complex of MSN-1 and adriamycin for endometrial cancer.
