abstract: Purpose of review:Many reports suggest the significance of pelvic lymph-node (PLN) adenectomy in patients with endometrial cancer. However, among these, there is controversy regarding not only what type of patients should have lymphadenectomy performed, but also what extent lymphadenectomy should be performed.Recent findings:It has been reported that PLN adenectomy has therapeutic significance in stage I grade 3 and more advanced endometrioid uterine cancer. However, the effects of para-aortic lymph-node adenectomy on its prognostic benefit have not been discussed.Summary:Patients with low-risk disease might not benefit from PLN adenectomy. However, PLN adenectomy might still have merit in low-risk patients, as there are inaccuracies of preoperative and intraoperative assessments. A complete lymphadenectomy is safe with minimum complications. At this point, hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with complete PLN adenectomy as the standard surgical procedure for endometrial cancer is thought to be reasonable. At present, the addition of p-aortic lymph-node adenectomy is regarded as an investigated protocol for endometrial cancer. However, p-aortic lymph-node adenectomy may have a therapeutic role for stage IIIC patients. Prospective randomized controlled trial composed of intermediate/high-risk patients should be conducted to clearly demonstrate prognostic improvement by p-aortic lymph-node adenectomy itself.
