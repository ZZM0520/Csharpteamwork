abstract: The current standards for surgical procedures and lymph node dissection of endometrial cancer in Japan were investigated using a questionnaire survey. The estimated clinical stages used in the questionnaire were predicted from preoperative diagnostic imaging, histopathology of endometrial biopsies and intraoperative findings using a new classification, Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) in 1988. Questionnaires were mailed to 235 institutions, and 212 institutions (90.2%) responded. As a standard surgery for endometrial cancer, institutions performed simple total hysterectomy or semiradical hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy, which accounted for 86% of all respondents. For stage I carcinoma, simple (44%) or semi-radical (47%) hysterectomy was carried out in 91% of institutions, while radical hysterectomy was selected in 84% of institutions when stage II carcinoma was diagnosed clinically. The consensus of this survey was that dissection of both the para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes can be omitted in G1 cases showing lesions confined to the endometrium, and that pelvic lymph nodes should be dissected, but para-aortic lymph node dissection could be omitted in G1 or G2 cases demonstrating myometrial invasion of 1/2 or less. Moreover, findings from this survey suggest that biopsy or dissection of the para-aortic lymph nodes was required in G3 cases, or in those patients diagnosed with myometrial invasion more than 1/2.
