abstract: Physical activity is involved in the regulation of metabolic and hormonal pathways and is one of the factors important for the maintenance of body weight; obesity is a risk factor for endometrial cancer. A connection between physical activity and endometrial cancer risk through hormonal mechanisms, possibly mediated by body weight, is biologically plausible. Only one study has investigated total physical activity, and no previous study has examined leisure time inactivity directly. We investigated the association of total physical activity and different types of physical activity with risk of endometrial cancer in the Swedish Mammography Cohort, a population-based prospective cohort, including 33,723 women and 199 endometrial cancer cases. After adjustments for potential confounders (age, body mass index, parity, history of diabetes, total fruit and vegetable intake, and education), the relative risks for endometrial cancer for the second to fourth quartile of total physical activity compared with the lowest one were 0.80 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.54-1.18], 0.87 (95% CI, 0.59-1.28), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.53-1.17). High leisure time inactivity (watching TV/sitting &gt;or=5 hours daily) compared with low was associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer (relative risk, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.05-2.61). The associations were not modified by body mass index. Findings from this study suggest that total physical activity is weakly inversely associated with endometrial cancer risk and that leisure time inactivity is statistically significantly associated with increased risk for endometrial cancer.
