abstract: Endometrial cancer is now the most common gynecologic malignancy. We investigate on new scientific evidences in endometrial cancer, particularly underlined updates in advanced endometrial cancer. Early stage endometrial cancer is the most frequent presentation; however, advanced endometrial cancer that occurs in 3-13 % of cases has bad prognosis. There are two types of endometrial cancer different in molecular pattern, therapeutic strategy and prognosis. Type I endometrial cancers develop in an environment of unopposed estrogen and often arise out of endometrial hyperplasia, characterized by mutations in the PTEN gene, K-ras, and microsatellite instability inception. Type II cancer is not an estrogen-related cancer, occurs predominantly in postmenopausal women, shows typical mutations in p53 and HER2/neu and has a poor prognosis. Preoperative characterization of the type's disease is an essential step for a right diagnosis and treatment. All patients should undergo to surgical staging, except those who are inoperable, according to FIGO recommendation. Surgical debulking, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval debulking can be strategy options.
