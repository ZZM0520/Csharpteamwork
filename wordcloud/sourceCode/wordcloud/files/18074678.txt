abstract: Mutation of neoplastic tumor suppressor genes, scribble, discs large, and lethal giant larvae (lgl), causes disruption of cell polarity and overproliferation of Drosophila epithelial cells and neuroblasts. Reduced expression of human homologue of lgl, Hugl-1, has been reported to be involved in development and progression of human colon cancer and malignant melanoma. To explore the association between Hugl-1 expression and clinical character in endometrial cancer, we examined the expression of Hugl-1 in primary endometrial cancer tissues. The expression of Hugl-1 mRNA in 86 primary endometrial cancer tissues was examined using semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All samples were categorized into two groups: Hugl-1 positive and Hugl-1 negative. Clinical data of each group were analyzed by Fisher's exact probability test and survival rates of each group were compared by Kaplan-Meier method and Log-rank test. Loss of Hugl-1 expression had correlation with the higher incidence of lymph node metastasis, but not to the patient's age at onset, distant metastasis, clinical stage, lymph or venous vessel invasion, or histopathological grade of differentiation. The Hugl-1-positive group had poorer prognosis compared with the Hugl-1-negative group. These results indicate that loss of Hugl-1 expression in endometrial cancer may contribute to lymph node metastasis and it can be a factor of poor prognosis.
