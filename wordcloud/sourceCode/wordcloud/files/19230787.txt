abstract: Objective:To review our institution's results with primary low dose rate (LDR) intracavitary brachytherapy using Heyman's capsules for medically inoperable cancer of the endometrium.Methods:The study was a retrospective review of inoperable early-stage endometrial cancer patients at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Canada, treated with primary radiotherapy from January 10, 1986 to July 17, 2006. Forty-four patients with International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical Stage I disease were included in the study. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to obtain estimates of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival, and disease-specific survival (DSS). Tumor grade was assessed as a potential predictor of OS by comparing survival curves using a log-rank test.Results:The median OS time was 75.5 months (95% confidence interval 55.6-95.3 months). For the entire group, the 5- and 10-year OS was 60.5% and 24.0%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year DSS was 87.7% and 79.7%, respectively. For a subset treated as planned, the 5- and 10-year OS was 54.5% and 34.5%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year DSS was 83.0% and 76.4%, respectively. When stratified by grade, trends in survival analysis are inversely related to grade. Both the trend analysis and the log-rank test were statistically significant at a p&lt;0.05 level.Conclusions:Our experience with LDR brachytherapy for the treatment of Stage I endometrial cancer is comparable to surgical treatment and to results reported in the literature for high dose rate brachytherapy. Further study that would help define the indications for a primary radiotherapeutic approach in early-stage endometrial cancer may lower current thresholds for recommending primary radiotherapy versus surgery.
