abstract: The aim of the study was to determine the value and the costs of routine follow-up for the detection of recurrences in patients treated for endometrial cancer. Between 1986 and 1995, 390 women with clinical stage I/II endometrial carcinoma were treated with combined surgery-radiation therapy. After treatment, follow-up was based on the clinical examination, a systematic Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and radiography (chest X-ray and abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography). 27 patients relapsed: 22 patients had symptoms and 5 were asymptomatic. None of the patients had recurrence detected on the routine Pap smear nor on the systematic chest X-ray. In conclusion, the follow-up of patients treated for endometrial cancer based on routine Pap smears and systematic radiography does not permit earlier detection of recurrences. Follow-up should simply include a clinical examination whose frequency should be based on prognostic factors. Approximately two-thirds of this cost was due to systematic examinations (Pap smears and radiography). Our results indicate that such expenditure could be avoided.
