abstract: Background:Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has emerged as an important steroid nuclear receptor in hormone dependent cancers, however few data are available regarding a potential role of GR in endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate expression of GR in primary and metastatic endometrial cancer lesions, and to assess the relationship between GR expression and clinical and histopathological variables and survival.Methods:Expression of GR was investigated by IHC in 724 primary tumors and 289 metastatic lesions (from 135 patients), and correlations with clinical and histopathological data and survival were explored.Results:Expression of GR was significantly increased in non-endometrioid tumors compared to endometrioid tumors, and was associated with markers of aggressive disease and poor survival both in univariate and multivariate analysis after correcting for age, FIGO stage and histologic grade. Within the subgroups of hormone receptor negative tumors (loss of androgen receptor, estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor) expression of GR was highly significantly associated with poor disease specific survival. There was an overall increase in GR expression from primary to metastatic lesions, and the majority of metastases expressed GR.Conclusion:GR expression in primary endometrial cancer is associated with aggressive disease and poor survival. The majority of metastatic endometrial cancer lesions express GR; therefore GR may represent a therapeutic target in the adjuvant therapy of poor prognosis early-stage as well as metastatic endometrial cancer.
