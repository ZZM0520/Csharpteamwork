abstract: Objective:Recent evidence suggests equivalent efficacy in terms of local control for adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) compared to external beam radiotherapy after surgery in patients with intermediate-high endometrial cancer. The objective of this study is to compare the quality of life (QoL) and sexual function of women with endometrial cancer that were treated with either surgery alone or surgery in combination with postoperative VBT.Methods:Women were interviewed at least 5 years after initial treatment for endometrial cancer. QoL was evaluated by using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and the cervical cancer module, CX-24. Sexual function was evaluated by using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Eligible women had early stage disease, were currently disease-free, and had undergone surgery and adjuvant VBT, but neither external beam radiotherapy nor systemic treatment. This study group were then compared using univariate and multivariate analyses with an age-matched control group comprising of endometrial cancer patients without adjuvant VBT.Results:Fifty-five patients (29 surgery plus VBT and 26 surgical controls without VBT) were included for analysis. With respect to QoL including, e.g., physical, role, emotional and social functioning and likewise in terms of sexual function univariate and multivariate analyses did not show significant differences between patients with VBT and the controls without VBT of any of the outcome measures.Conclusion:Adjuvant VBT after surgery does not seem to have a significant impact on quality of life and sexual function in endometrial cancer survivors.
