abstract: Background:Though laparoscopic surgery has recently been applied in the treatment of early-stage endometrial cancer, the presence of a large uterus is a hindrance to specimen extraction from the abdominal cavity. We describe a laparoscopic surgical technique for endometrial cancer involving the extraction of the resected specimen through an umbilical zigzag incision.Case presentation:A 63-year-old woman with endometrial cancer underwent a total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy that was performed laparoscopically. The surgical specimen was extracted through an umbilical zigzag incision. This umbilical zigzag incision created a larger fascial and peritoneal opening, facilitating the removal of the specimen. The final histopathologic results revealed stage 1A G1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma and multiple uterine leiomyomas. Three months after surgery, the wound in the umbilical region was inconspicuous, along with the inward movement of the umbilicus.Conclusions:A laparoscopic surgical technique for endometrial cancer involving the extraction of the specimen through an umbilical zigzag incision seems to reduce the difficulties associated with laparoscopic surgery and maintains cosmesis. Further analyses involving larger numbers of cases and long-term follow-up periods are warranted to evaluate this surgical method.
