abstract: Objective:To identify prognostic factors of recurrent endometrial cancer, and clarify whether the treatment-free interval (TFI) predicts outcome in a wide spectrum of patients.Study design:The clinical data of 60 patients treated for recurrent stage I-IV endometrial cancer between 1997 and 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to estimate overall survival (OS) following recurrence and determine the factors influencing outcomes.Results:The median age at initial treatment was 59 (range 38-80) years and the median post-recurrence overall survival time was 40.0 (range 1.8-156.7) months. Multivariate analysis showed lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio (HR) 2.80; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.29-6.09; p=0.009), TFI (HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.15-0.76; p=0.008), and symptomatic recurrence (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.11-4.83, p=0.0025) were independent prognostic factors. Patients whose tumors recurred after a TFIâ‰¥12 months had better response rates than did those with a TFI&lt;12 months (p&lt;0.001).Conclusion:TFI is a significant prognostic factor in recurrent endometrial cancer. Furthermore, the effect of chemotherapy on recurrent endometrial cancer is probably influenced by the duration of TFI.
