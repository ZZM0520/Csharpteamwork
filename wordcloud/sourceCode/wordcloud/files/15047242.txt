abstract: Background:Young patients with endometrial cancer who desire to preserve their fertility often decline hysterectomy in favor of conservative progestin therapy. Proper candidates should have disease confined to the uterus and a well-differentiated tumor. One of the evolving techniques to evaluate the extent of the disease and myometrial or cervical invasion is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Case:A young patient with early-stage endometrial cancer initially declined surgery and was treated with megestrol. MRI suggested myoinvasion, and the patient consented to surgical staging. The final pathology revealed no residual carcinoma.Conclusions:The accuracy of MRI in detecting myoinvasion is limited, and as such results should be interpreted with caution when this information is used in counseling a young patient regarding surgical staging for endometrial cancer.
