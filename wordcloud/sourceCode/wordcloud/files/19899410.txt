abstract: Objective:Lymph node involvement is the single most important factor in the prognosis of endometrial cancer, because it is predictive of locoregional and distant metastases. The purpose of our study was to determine whether lymphadenectomy is useful in the surgical staging of endometrial cancer and if it may help establish a more accurate prognosis and reduce the need for postoperative therapy in patients without surgical complications.Study design:We conducted a retrospective study on 55 patients with diagnosis of endometrial cancer.Results:Surgical staging of patients undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy (47/55) showed that 59.6% of cases (n = 28) had Stage I cancer (IA in 4, IB in 16, IC in 8), 17.02% (n = 8) Stage II (IIA in 3, IIB in 5), 21.2% (n = 10) Stage III (IIIB in 5, IIIC in 5), and 2.1% (n = 1) Stage IVA. In the remaining eight patients with a very high anesthesiologic risk (ASA 4), surgical staging was incomplete because they underwent only node palpation.Conclusion:In conclusion, as we wait for the sentinel lymph node technique to demonstrate satisfactory results and be standardized also for endometrial cancer, we believe that surgical lymph node dissection plays a crucial role in debulking this type of cancer. When performed by a good surgical oncology team, it does not entail a significantly increased operative risk.
