abstract: Objectives:The aim of this study was to determine long-term survival and late complications of intermediate risk endometrial cancer (Stage IG3, IC, and II) treated with full lymphadenectomy and brachytherapy without teletherapy.Methods:Two-hundred sixty-five consecutive patients underwent surgical staging for endometrial cancer consisting of hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and bilateral pelvic and periaortic lymphadenectomy. Sixty-six patients had intermediate risk endometrial cancer (Stage IG3, IC, and II) and received postoperative brachytherapy without teletherapy. Mean age was 68 years and mean weight was 188 lb. Seventy-seven percent had associated medical illness.Results:At a mean follow-up of 4.4 years, Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year progression free survival is 97%. Two patients (3%) developed distant recurrence (abdomen, lungs) with no vaginal or pelvic recurrence. Major complications occurred in 6% of patients.Conclusions:Complete lymphadenectomy with brachytherapy without teletherapy for intermediate risk endometrial cancer results in excellent progression-free survival and minimal major morbidity.
