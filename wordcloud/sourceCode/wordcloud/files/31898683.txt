abstract: Sister Mary Joseph's nodule (SMJN) is an umbilical mass referring to an intraabdominal and/or pelvic tumor's metastasis. SMJN is frequently associated with gynecological malignancies, but only 30 cases of SMJN originated from endometrial cancer have been described in the literature. We reported a case of SMJN detected within the primary diagnosis of endometrial cancer, in which a 1-year vaginal relapse occurs. A robotic single-site total hysterectomy and a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed to treat the primary tumor, followed by an adjuvant radiotherapy. The SMJN was resected during the surgical procedure. The relapse was treated by a partial colpectomy. No evidence of disease has been observed to date, and an overall survival of 31 months has been achieved. Due to the rare occurrence of an umbilical metastasis from an endometrial carcinoma, SMJN is difficult to recognize in this contest; nevertheless, its diagnosis is becoming increasingly important in relation to the choice of a proper treatment.
