abstract: Purpose:Previous studies of stage II endometrial cancer have included cancers with cervical glandular involvement, a factor no longer associated with risk of recurrence. In order to better assess relapse patterns and the impact of adjuvant therapy, a retrospective analysis was conducted for patients with modern stage II endometrial cancer, defined as cervical stromal invasion.Materials and methods:Patients diagnosed with surgically staged FIGO stage II endometrial cancer at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center from 1990-2013 were reviewed. Factors associated with rates of locoregional control (LRC), distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the log rank test.Results:110 patients with FIGO stage II disease were identified. Most (84.5%) received EBRTÂ±BT, with 13.6% receiving BT alone. With a median follow-up of 64.6months, the 5-year actuarial rates of LRC, DM, DFS, and OS were 94.9%, 85.1%, 67.9%, and 75.0%, respectively. With 5 locoregional failures, the only factor predictive of LRC was pelvic lymph node dissection. Characteristics associated with DM included age, LVSI, depth of myometrial invasion, and receipt of chemotherapy. Factors predictive of both DFS and OS were age, grade, adverse histology, LVSI, depth of myometrial invasion, and receipt of chemotherapy.Conclusions:This represents the largest single-institution study for modern stage II endometrial cancer, confirming high rates of pelvic disease control after surgery and adjuvant therapy. With most patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy, the predominant mode of failure, albeit low in absolute number, remains distant metastases.
