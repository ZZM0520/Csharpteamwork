abstract: Objective:To assess the use of French Cancer Institute recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of endometrial cancer.Methods:Retrospective observational study involving 137 patients with endometrial cancer between 2011 and 2013.Results:Both MRI and pathological assessment with correct report as recommended were used for 66.4% of patients with endometrial cancer. For patients with correct preoperative assessment, 44.9% of patients were uncorrectly classified and upgraded on final pathological analysis of hysterectomy concerning lymph node involvement risk. These patients did not have confident surgical assessment, according this risk.Conclusion:To improve relevance of preoperative assessment in endometrial cancer, radiological and pathological expertise is required. However, even performed optimally, preoperative assessment does not allow correct risk stratification of lymph node involvement in endometrial cancer. This ineffective stratification leads to propose sentinel lymph node biopsy with hysterectomy in case of preoperative low risk endometrial cancer assessment.
