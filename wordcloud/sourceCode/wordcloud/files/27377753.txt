abstract: Background:Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare idiopathic disorder that occurs in women of childbearing age, and consists of a diffuse proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle cells along the thoracic and abdominal lymphogenous route.Case presentation:We experienced a case of a 47-yo woman with recent history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed with endometrial cancer, initially suspected to have metastasized to pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes based on preoperative diagnostic imaging. Subsequent pathological diagnosis revealed stage IB endometrial cancer without evidence of lymph node involvement. Instead, enlarged pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes were found to be due to extrapulmonary LAM, from a primary lesion found inside the uterine myometrium. SLE improved after surgery.Conclusion:This is the first reported case of comorbid endometrial cancer, SLE, and aggressive LAM metastasizing to regional lymph nodes, and strengthens the clinical evidence for a common role of mTOR pathway hyperactivity and estrogen responsiveness in the pathophysiology of metastasizing lesions of the genital tract.
