abstract: Objective:The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic significance of DNA ploidy in patients with endometrial cancer.Methods:Between October 1988 and January 1997, DNA ploidy was determined prospectively in 208 women who were staged surgically by a standard protocol that included pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Median follow-up was 48 months.Results:Diploid tumors were identified in 154 (74%) patients and aneuploid tumors in 54 (26%). Patients with aneuploid tumors had a significantly higher prevalence of metastases to the cervix, adnexa, and omentum, malignant pelvic cytology, and advanced surgical stage. Patients with aneuploid tumors had a 4.5 times higher prevalence of pelvic lymph node metastases and a 5.8 times higher prevalence of para-aortic lymph node metastases. A significantly higher proportion of patients with aneuploid tumors was diagnosed with recurrent or progressive endometrial cancer (22.2 versus 6.5%, P = 0.002). Patients with aneuploid tumors had a significantly lower rate of survival from cancer death (P = 0.038) with 83% versus 94% surviving 5 years.Conclusion:Patients with aneuploid tumors are at high risk for lymph node metastases and should be surgically staged, including pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Aneuploidy confers a risk for endometrial cancer death and these patients should be candidates for clinical trials evaluating treatment following surgery.
