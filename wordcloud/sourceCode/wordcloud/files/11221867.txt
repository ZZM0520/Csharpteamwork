abstract: Common variants among genes coding for enzymes in sex steroid biosynthetic pathways may influence the risk of endometrial cancer. We examined the association between endometrial cancer risk and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) by CYP17 genotype using 51 incident cases and 391 randomly selected controls from a multiethnic cohort in Hawaii and Los Angeles, California. The relative risk of endometrial cancer was calculated for ever use versus never use of ERT by CYP17 genotype (TT, TC, and CC). We found that women who reported ever taking ERT were more than twice as likely to develop endometrial cancer as women who never took ERT [odds ratio (OR), 2.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-4.23]. Among these women, the risk of endometrial cancer was higher for women homozygous for the CYP17 T allele (OR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.64-10.3), but not for women with the C allele (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.53-3.21). These preliminary findings suggest that CYP17 or other variants in estrogen biosynthesis or metabolism pathways may be potential markers of endometrial cancer susceptibility due to ERT.
