abstract: Objective:To assess the immunohistochemical expression of p53, bcl-2, c-erbB-2, Ki-67, estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), MMP-7, MMP-26 in samplex from diagnostic hysteroscopy and therapeutic hysterectomy in endometrial cancer patients.Design:Experimental prospective study.Setting:Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Institute of Human Genetics, Department of Pathology, Palacky University Medical School and University Hospital, Olomouc.Methods:We studied 43 cases of primary untreated endometrial carcinoma in which the grade and immunomarkers assessed by histoscore were investigated in specimens obtained at hysteroscopy and hysterectomy.Results:Based on hysterosopy, 31 (72.1%) patients were classified as G1, G2 7 (16.3%) and G3 5 (11.6%) respective. In grade 1 the concordance rate was 77.4% of cases, in grade 2 it was in 14.3% of cases and in grade 3 it was in 80.0% of cases. In hysterosocpy samples the p53 expression was found in 23 (53.5%), bcl-2 in 37 (86.0%), c-erbB-2 in 20 (46.5%), Ki-67 in 29 (67.4%), ER in 37 (86.0%), PR in 36 (83.7%), MMP-7 in 25 (58.1%) and MMP-26 in 23 (53.5%) cases. Expression in hysterectomy specimens was p53 positive in 13 (30.2%), bcl-2 positive in 33 (76.7%), c-erbB-2 positive in 24 (55.8%), Ki-67 positive in 25 (58.1%), ER positive in 36 (83.7%), PR positive in 40 (93.0%), MMP-7 positive in 27 (62.8%) and MMP-26 positive in 23 (53.5%) of total 43 cases.Conclusion:We found high concordance in expression of p53, bcl-2, PR and MMP-7 in hysteroscopy and hysterectomy samples which could be of importance for therapeutic algorithm in endometrial cancer patients.
