abstract: Isolated para-arotic lymph node recurrence of endometrial cancer occurs occasionally, but management of such patients has been controversial. The authors performed cytoreductive surgery in four patients with isolated para-aortic lymph node metastasis of recurrent endometrial cancer. They resected metastatic foci by laparoscopic method for three cases and by laparotomy for one case. After the surgery, three cases underwent radiation therapy and one case was given chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy. After the treatment for recurrence, progression-free interval was from 64 to 127 months and all cases had no evidence of disease. Cytoreductive surgery may improve prognosis of isolated para-aortic lymph node metastasis of recurrent endometrial cancer. As laparoscopic surgery is superior to laparotomy in terms of less invasiveness, further examinations will reveal that it is feasible for such an isolated lymph node recurrence situation.
