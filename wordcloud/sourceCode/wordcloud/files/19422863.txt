abstract: Endometrial carcinoma is the fourth most common cancer among women in the United States. Surgical pathologic staging has been the standard of care since 1988, which consists of analysis of collected peritoneal fluid, hysterectomy/oophorectomy, and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. In 2005, it was further recommended that essentially all women with endometrial cancer who choose to undergo surgery have pelvic and para-aortic lymph node analysis. Despite this recommendation, there still remains controversy as to whether all patients with endometrial cancer should undergo full lymph node dissection. In this review, we assess the evidence surrounding this controversy and conclude that women with endometrial cancer should undergo complete lymphadenectomy at the time of surgery. Furthermore, we evaluate the evidence regarding laparoscopic surgical staging as a safe and effective alternative to the more invasive traditional laparotomy. Finally, for those patients who a gynecologic oncologist is not readily available to perform a complete lymph node dissection, we evaluate the various imaging studies and their utility as preoperative triage modalities.
