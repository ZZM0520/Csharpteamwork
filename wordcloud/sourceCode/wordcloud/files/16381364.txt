abstract: Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopy in the management of early stage endometrial cancer.Methods:Fifty-two patients with endometrial cancer who underwent surgical staging consisting of total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection, and cytology between 1998 to 2002 were included in the study. Laparotomy and laparoscopy were randomly offered to patients upon admittance.Results:Of 52 patients, 26 underwent laparotomy and the remaining 26 underwent laparoscopic staging surgery. No significant difference existed between the demographic characteristics of the 2 groups. The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 18.2 in the laparoscopic group and 21.1 in the laparotomic group (P&gt;0.05). Pelvic lymph node metastases were detected in 7.7% of the patients in the laparoscopy group and 15.4% in the laparotomy group, and the difference was not significant. Adjuvant radiotherapy was applied later to 42.3% of the laparoscopy group and 38.5% of the laparotomy group. Operative morbidity was higher in the laparotomy group mainly because of postoperative wound infection, and the patients in the laparotomy group had a longer hospital stay.Conclusion:Laparoscopic surgery is a method that can be applied as well as laparotomy in the management of endometrial cancer. Lymph node number and detection of lymph node metastasis did not differ significantly in laparotomic and laparoscopic approaches. Wound infections were more frequent in laparotomies.
