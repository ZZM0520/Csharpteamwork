abstract: Health-related quality of life (HQoL) is assessed through the patients' own evaluation of the impact that a disease and its treatment may have on some of the physical, psychological and social aspects of their lives. The purpose of this study is to describe the HQoL of patients with endometrial cancer who are free of disease after undergoing external irradiation. An HQoL questionnaire was designed and validated, and consisted of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and 80 additional questions. The patients provided self-reported assessments at the end of radiotherapy, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months later. Forty-nine out of 66 potential subjects participated in the study, which was confined to the period during which the, women were disease free. Most patients experience physical side effects at the end of treatment and up to 6 months thereafter; 10% of the patients have chronic local symptoms and a large number of the patients think about their treatment even two years later. The patients' overall evaluation of their quality of life is lower than that of a matched population of healthy women.
