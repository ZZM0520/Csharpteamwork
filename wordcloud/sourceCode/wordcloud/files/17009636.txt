abstract: Objective:To evaluate the effect of body mass index (BMI) on clinical, surgical, pathologic features, and surgical morbidity in the management of patients with endometrial cancer.Materials &amp; methods:All endometrial cancer patients who were surgically treated in our institution between January 1, 2003 and January 1, 2006 were eligible for the study. Forty-two out of 60 patients were included in the analysis from our cancer database. The patients were divided into three groups: BMI &lt; 30, BMI 30-40, BMI &gt; 40. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS for Windows (version 11; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).Results:Lymphadenectomy as part of surgical staging was performed in 90.5% of all patients. Although patients with a BMI &gt; 40 were less likely to have positive lymph vascular space invasion (LVSI) (p = 0.042), chance of deep myometrial invasion and positive lymph nodes (18%) were the same as for patients with a BMI &lt; 30. Patients with a BMI &gt; 40 had statistically longer operating times when compared to patients with a BMI &lt; 40 (p = 0.039). Wound separation rate was statistically higher in the morbidly obese patients (p = 0.01). Average number of lymph nodes removed, hospital days, intraoperative and overall postoperative complication rates did not differ among the three groups (p &gt; 0.05).Conclusions:This study confirms that comprehensive surgical staging can be performed adequately and safely in obese and morbidly obese endometrial cancer patients with no difference in length of hospital stay, intraoperative or postoperative complications. As a result adjuvant treatment of morbidly obese patients can be planned accordingly preventing under or over treatment.
