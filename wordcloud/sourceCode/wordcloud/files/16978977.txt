abstract: Endometrial cancer is the second most common gynaecological malignancy. The usual presentation with post-menopausal bleeding results in an early diagnosis in most cases and thus there is opportunity for cure. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is pivotal in the decision-making process regarding treatment options. We present a review of the magnetic resonance (MR) findings to illustrate its role in the staging of endometrial cancer.
