abstract: The association between treatment variation and survival of women with endometrial cancer was investigated. A retrospective cohort based upon the complete Scottish population registered on in-patient and day-case hospital discharge data (Scottish Morbidity Record-1) and cancer registration (Scottish Morbidity Record-6) coded C54 and C55 in ICD10, between 1st January 1996 to 31st December 1997 were analysed. Seven hundred and three patients who underwent surgical treatment out of 781 patients that were diagnosed with endometrial cancer in Scotland during 1996 and 1997. The overall quality of surgical staging was poor. The quality of staging was related to both the year that the surgeon passed the Member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists examination and also to 'specialist' status but was not related to surgeon caseload. Two clinically important prognostic factors were found to be associated with survival; whether the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology stage was documented, RHR=2.0 (95% CI=1.3 to 3.1) and also to the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, RHR=2.2 (95% CI=1.5 to 3.5). The associations with survival were strongest in patients with advanced disease, International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology stages 1C through to stage 3. Deficiencies in staging and variations in the use of adjuvant radiotherapy represent a possible source of avoidable mortality in patients with endometrial cancer. Consequently, there should be a greater emphasis on improving the overall quality of surgical staging in endometrial cancer.
