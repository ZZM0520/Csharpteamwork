abstract: Objective:To compare the accuracy of transvaginal sonography and magnetic rezonance imaging (MRI) in determining the depth of myometrial invasion in proven cases of endometrial cancer.Design:A prospective study.Setting:Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Department of Medical Genetics and Fetal Medicine, Department of Radiology, University Hospital, Olomouc.Methods:Fifty five patients diagnosed as having FIGO stage I endometrial carcinoma were evaluated preoperatively by transvaginal ultrasound; 44 cases of the same group were also evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The degree of invasion evaluated by transvaginal sonography and by MRI was compared to the pathological specimens.Results:Transvaginal sonography was successful in evaluating myometrial invasion in 44 of 55 cases (accuracy 80%, sensitivity 80%, specificity 88%, positive predictive value 77%, negative predictive value 87%). Evaluation with MRI was accurate in 37 of 44 cases (accuracy 84%, sensitivity 84%, specificity 91%, positive predictive value 81%, negative predictive value 91%).Conclusion:Although MRI is superior to transvaginal sonography in evaluating myometrial invasion, it is expensive and time consuming, and would not be suitable as a screening test for depth of invasion. On the other hand, transvaginal sonography is relatively low-cost technique, which can be easily performed and repeated. However, it requires more operator experience than MRI in order to achieve high accuracy.
