abstract: <b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the clinical outcomes and feasibility of multi-modality adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, which was conducted as postoperative chemotherapy, radiation, and consolidation chemotherapy (CRC) mode for the treatment of advanced endometrial cancer. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis of 124 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages Ⅲ and Ⅳ endometrial cancer from Jan. 2004 to Oct. 2012 was conducted in Peking University People<i>'</i>s Hospital and Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital. Inclusion criteria were comprehensive staging procedure including hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and (or) selective pelvic aortic lymphadenectomy, and treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy and (or) radiation. The average age of these patients was (55.9±8.4) years old (range from 23 to 79 years old). According to different postoperative adjuvant treatment modes, the patients were divided into CRC group, chemotherapy-radiotherapy (CR) group and single chemotherapy (C) group. The survival and side effects of the three groups were compared. <b>Results:</b> (1) One hundred and twenty-four patients with advanced stage endometrial cancer were identified and received postoperative adjuvant therapies.Sixty-one (49.2%, 61/124) cases of them received postoperative CRC fashion, 19 (15.3%, 19/124) received postoperative CR and 44 (35.5%, 44/124) cases received C. The age, stage, grade and type of surgery of the three groups were not significantly different (all <i>P&gt;</i>0.05); while, the pathology, chemotherapy cycles and chemotherapy regimens differed significantly (all <i>P&lt;</i>0.05). (2) The progression-free survivals (PFS) of the patients with CRC, CR, and C group were (121±7), (68±15), and (100±11) months, respectively. The 3-year PFS rates were 87.9%, 43.7%, and 61.4%, respectively. The 5-year PFS rates were 82.2%, 36.4%, and 61.4%, respectively. The above indicators were significantly higher in the CRC group than in the CR group (all <i>P&lt;</i>0.01), and there was no difference between the CRC group and the C group (<i>P=</i>0.037). The overall survival (OS) of patients with CRC, CR, and C group were (128±6), (80±12), and (99±10) months, respectively. The 3-year OS rates were 87.8%, 72.4%, and 67.1%, the 5-year OS rate were 84.2%, 54.3%, and 64.1%, respectively. The above indicators were significantly higher in the CRC group than those in the CR group and C group (all <i>P&lt;</i>0.01). (3) There was no difference in the frequency of adverse effects either chemotherapy, such as severe bone suppression or radiotherapy; hepatotoxicity,blood transfusion, dose modifications; or cycle delays between the CRC, CR and C group (all <i>P&gt;</i>0.05). (4) In the univariate analysis shown that, stage, the fashion of postoperative adjuvant therapy and type of surgery were risk factors for tumor progression in patients with advanced endometrial cancer (<i>P&lt;</i>0.05). After adjusted for FIGO stage and type of surgery, the tumor progression hazard ratio (<i>HR</i>) was 3.931 (95%<i>CI</i>: 1.734-8.914, <i>P=</i>0.001) for the CR group and 2.188 (95<i>%CI</i>: 1.010-4.741, <i>P=</i>0.047) for the C group, compared to the CRC group. <b>Conclusion:</b> Sequential CRC delivered in a "sandwich" fashion for the treatment in advanced endometrial cancer could significantly improve the 3-year and 5-year OS rates and have a similar adverse effect profile compared with other sequencing modalities.
