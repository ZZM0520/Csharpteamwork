abstract: Objective:The clinical benefit of surveillance imaging in endometrial cancer remains undefined. This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV) of surveillance imaging in endometrial cancer.Methods:A total of 128 patients in first remission after treatment for endometrial cancer (uterine papillary serous, clear cell, stage III endometroid) who had surveillance imaging were retrospectively identified. The surveillance period was defined from the time of first-negative scan after treatment to the time when treatment was started for recurrent disease. Reports of surveillance scans were reviewed for the presence or absence of findings. The primary outcome was PPV of surveillance imaging. Cost and radiation exposure from surveillance imaging were also evaluated.Results:A total of 128 patients had 707 surveillance scans (computed tomography, positron emission tomography-computed tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-d-glucose, magnetic resonance image, and bone scans). Median follow-up was 54 months (range: 9-173). Of all, 47 patients (37%) started therapy for recurrent endometrial cancer at the discretion of the treating physician. PPV of all surveillance imaging was 57.7%. Per patient, the mean number of surveillance scans was 5.6 (range: 2-21). The mean cost of imaging was $4200 (range: $1200-$18,700) and mean radiation exposure was 109.6mSV (range: 16-445mSv).Conclusions:Surveillance imaging detected a significant number of recurrences in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer at a reasonable cost related to the overall risk. Well-designed prospective imaging trials are warranted to assess the clinical benefit of surveillance imaging.
