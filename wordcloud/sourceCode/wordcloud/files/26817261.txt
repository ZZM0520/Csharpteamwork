abstract: Endometrial canceris the most common gynecological cancer. It is positive that more than 53% of diagnosed cases of endometrial cancer are in first stage when the therapeutic options are more successive. More and more gynecologists in addition to the normal clinical and histological tests expand the information for the neoplastic process with biochemical and immunological markers-tumor markers, hormones, lymphocyte population, cytokines, markers for lesion-inflammatory processes, etc. Several biological mechanisms track the connection between overweight and endometrial neoplastic risk. In the surgical practice is increasing the interest towards the cytokine group as independent prognostic factors, aggressiveness and options for treatment of the neoplastic process. The cytokine profile can be used as factor for evaluation of the primary neoplastic immune impairment as well as for a choice of surgical intervention. This is extremely important for obese patients because obesity is turning into worldwide medico-social problem.
