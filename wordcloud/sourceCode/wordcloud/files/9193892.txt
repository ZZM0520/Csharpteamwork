abstract: Most instances of endometrial cancer are potentially preventable. Unopposed endogenous estrogen stimulation of the endometrium has been shown to be the predisposing risk factor in most cases. Risk factors have been well-delineated, and it is important to recognize and treat the progesterone-deficient patient. Low-dose oral contraceptive pills in healthy, nonsmoking, older reproductive-aged women are an underutilized treatment modality. The many noncontraceptive benefits of longterm oral contraceptive use until the menopause should be explained to the patient, including the prevention of ovarian and endometrial cancer, the maintenance of bone density, and a reduction in the many surgical procedures performed for menstrual disorders. Progestin therapy in older reproductive-aged women and postmenopausal women with unopposed estrogen production is mandatory to prevent endometrial cancer. Knowledge and skill in simple endometrial sampling techniques performed in patients with known risk factors for endometrial cancer will often detect premalignant lesions that are treatable with progestin therapy or surgery.
