abstract: Objective:To test the association of endometrial cancer with the lymphotoxin-alpha (LTalpha) C804A and A252G polymorphisms, a hospital-based incident case-control study was performed in Japanese subjects.Methods:The cases comprised 110 endometrial cancer patients, and the controls were 220 age-matched cancer-free females.Results:The LTalpha C804A and A252G polymorphisms were in complete linkage disequilibrium. We performed conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, which revealed that the LTalpha 252AG and 804CA variant genotypes were associated with a significantly reduced risk of endometrial cancer (OR=0.51, 95% CI=0.31-0.86, P=0.011). Being homozygous of the LTalpha 252G and 804A alleles was not associated with the risk of endometrial cancer. However, the presence of at least one variant LTalpha allele was associated with a significantly lower risk of endometrial cancer (OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.33-0.87, P=0.012). After adjusting for potential confounders (body mass index, age at menarche, parity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family history of endometrial cancer, hormone replacement therapy, smoking status, and alcohol consumption), the risk of endometrial cancer was significantly lower both in carriers of one variant allele and in carriers of either one or two of the variant alleles (OR=0.47, 95% CI=0.26-0.85, P=0.017; OR=0.50, 95% CI=0.28-0.89, P=0.019; respectively).Conclusion:The results suggest that these LTalpha polymorphisms play an important role in the tumorigenesis of endometrial cancer.
