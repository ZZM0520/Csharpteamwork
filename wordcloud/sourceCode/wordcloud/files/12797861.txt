abstract: Routine screening for endometrial carcinoma is currently not justified. Postmenopausal women need to be educated about the importance of seeking attention if any vaginal bleeding occurs. All postmenopausal bleeding requires review and appropriate investigation. Women taking tamoxifen have a higher risk of endometrial cancer and should report any bleeding or spotting; however, ultrasound screening is not recommended for asymptomatic women taking tamoxifen. Families with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer have a higher risk of endometrial cancer and require counselling about this risk. A Pap test is not a screening test for endometrial cancer, but the incidental finding of endometrial cells on a Pap smear in a postmenopausal woman requires investigation.
