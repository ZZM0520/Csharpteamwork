abstract: Objective:The purposes of this study were to present an endometrial cancer case with a first sign of bone metastasis, and to reveal factors affecting survival and the appropriate treatment methods for bone metastases.Materials and methods:A total of 101 case reports that presented with bone metastasis of endometrial cancer were reviewed in this study.Results:Survival time in the patients without surgical treatment for bone metastasis was found to be 12 months (95% CI = 5.89 - 18.10) and 42 months in patients who underwent surgical treatment in addition to one or more of chemo-radio-hormonotherapies (95% CI = 16.58 - 67.41) (p = .006). Histological type of cancer, extra-osseous metastasis, and lack of surgery were the factors significantly affecting survival (p = 0.012, p = 0.002, and p = 0.038, respectively).Conclusion:Histological type and the presence of extra-osseous involvement are important prognostic markers in endometrial cancer patients with bone metastasis. It may be appropriate to implement combination therapies including surgery in the treatment of bone metastases.
