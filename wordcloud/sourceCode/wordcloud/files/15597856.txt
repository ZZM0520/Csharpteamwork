abstract: Recurrent endometrial cancer with both local and distant metastasis is very difficult to treat. A 55-year-old endometrial adenocarcinoma patient with bulky central recurrences and pelvic and inguinal lymph node metastases underwent laparotomy and paraaortic, pelvic and inguinal lymphadenectomy followed by concurrent chemoradiation (with cisplatin) to the paraaortic and inguinal lymph nodes as well as the whole pelvis. Neck and mediastinal lymph node metastasis emerged during treatment. Neck-node radiation and epirubicin was added followed by paclitaxel and carboplatin. Complete remission was achieved. Ten months later, isolated central re-recurrence happened and total pelvic exenteration was performed. The patient has survived without further recurrence for more than five years after the exenteration. Therefore, a multimodality approach with a combination of radical resection (even pelvic exenteration), radiotherapy and chemotherapy could be offered to well-selected patients with recurrent endometrial cancer despite out-of-field progression during therapy and in-field local failure to initial salvage treatment.
