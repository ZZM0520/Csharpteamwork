abstract: Objectives:Endometrial cancers (ECs) are the most common gynaecological cancers in well developed countries. Diabetes and metabolic syndrome are among the biggest risk factors. Nesfatin-1, the adipokine derivative of NUCB2 (nucleobindin derivative 2) is linked to the clinical course of EC. Molecular factors, including mutations in MLH1 and MHS2 genes, c-MET and ARID1A are also related to prognosis in endometrial cancer.Material and methods:Using sections of paraffin-embedded preparations and immunohistochemistry, the expression of NESF1, MLH1, MSH2,c-MET and ARID1A were examined.Results:In this study on protein expression, EC tissues manifested (although insignificantly) an elevated expression of NESF-1 in type II EC. In type I EC, NESF-1 expression was significantly higher in G1 in comparison to G2 and G3 together. A significantly lower expression of MLH1 was demonstrated in type I EC.Conclusions:The most pronounced expression involved c-MET in all EC I and EC II tissues (in over 80% of cases). A tendency was detected for a high expression of NESF-1 in patients with type II EC, who also exhibited a high expression of MSH2.
