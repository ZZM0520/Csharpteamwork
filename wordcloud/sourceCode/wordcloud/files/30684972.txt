abstract: Background:Currently, ribosome-binding protein 1 (RRBP1) is considered to be a novel oncogene that is overexpressed in colorectal cancer, lung cancer, mammary cancer, esophageal cancer and other carcinomas. However, the relationship between RRBP1 and endometrioid-type endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains unknown. Our purpose is to explore the function of RRBP1 in endometrioid-type endometrial carcinoma.Methods:We investigated the expression of RRBP1 protein by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from one hundred thirty patients with endometrioid-type endometrial carcinoma. We also evaluated the differences in RRBP1 expression between endometrial cancer samples (n = 35) and normal endometrial tissues (n = 19) by western blotting.Results:RRBP1 was more highly expressed in endometrial cancer samples than in normal samples (P &lt; 0.05). High levels of expression of RRBP1 were strongly correlated with pathological features, such as the Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, histological grade, depth of myometrial invasion and lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, RRBP1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with EC (both P &lt; 0.05).Conclusion:This experiment identifies the utility of RRBP1 in predicting EC prognosis, revealing that it may be a potential target for therapeutics of EC.
