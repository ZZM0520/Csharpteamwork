abstract: Endometrial carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract. The major non-invasive diagnostic method is ultrasound. Endometrial thickness (double layer) is measured by transvaginal sonography. The cut-off value in patients with postmenopausal bleeding is still controversial, although in patients with endometrial thickness below 4 mm (or 5 mm respectively), malignancy can be excluded with high probability. If the endometrium measures more than 4 mm (or more than 5 mm respectively) or the patient presents with continuous bleeding, hysteroscopy and curettage should be performed in order to obtain histologic diagnosis. Sonographic findings like structure and demarcation of the endometrium increase diagnostic specificity only when combined with the measurement of endometrial thickness. Measuring the fluid within the uterine cavity does not seem to be useful in differentiating malignant from benign disorders. The extent of surgery depends on the preoperative estimation of the tumor stage which is particularly important for elder patients with increased morbidity. Transvaginal sonography has not been widely accepted to predict the depth of myometrial invasion or cervical infiltration. Although promising studies exist, additional examinations have to be done in order to determine the role of transvaginal sonography beside other methods (CT, MRT). This article on transvaginal ultrasound reviews current data on the method's capacity to identify endometrial cancer and to diagnose the depth of invasion.
