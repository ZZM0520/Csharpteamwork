abstract: The object of this study was to clarify the association of angiogenic factor, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF)/thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase) with clinicopathological factors including tumor angiogenesis and patient outcome in endometrial cancer. There was no correlation between the expression of PD-ECGF in cancer cells and any of the clinicopathological variables. Immunopositivity for PD-ECGF in stroma cells was significantly higher in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. The microvessel counts correlated with PD-ECGF positive stroma cells (p&lt;0.0001). Disease-free survival was significantly worse in patients with marked PD-ECGF expression in stromal cells and high microvessel count. A multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model showed that high microvessel counts independently predicted disease-free survival as well as stage and myometrial invasion. The expression of PD-ECGF in stroma cells may play a crucial role in the promotion of angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis can be used to predict prognosis in patients with endometrial cancer.
