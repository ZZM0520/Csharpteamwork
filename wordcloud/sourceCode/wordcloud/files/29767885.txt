abstract: Thickened uterine endometrium with abnormal uterine bleeding highly suggests endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma. A case of 35-year-old nulliparous woman came to our department with endometrial mass manifesting as endometrial cancer. Transrectal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an 8x6 cm multicystic, ill-defined mass compacted at the uterine endometrium, the anterior wall of the uterus, and 3x3 cm heterogenous mass at the left adnexa. The edometrial mass showed multiple septations with enhancement and low-signal intensity on T2-weighted images. After endometrial biopsy was done and simple hyperplasia without atypia was observed at the histopathologic finding, the patient underwent robot-assisted laparoscopy and diagnosed as adenomyoma at the frozen pathology. After adenomyomectomy, permanent pathologic analysis revealed the same result and she recovered without any complications and responded well to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy.
