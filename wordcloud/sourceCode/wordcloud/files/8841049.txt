abstract: One hundred and sixty patients with FIGO stage I and II endometrial cancer entered this study. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI; 61 cases), fractional curettage (110 cases) and hysteroscopy (119 cases) were performed to evaluate the presence of cervical involvement, and the findings were histologically compared with specimens obtained in abdominal hysterectomy. MRI showed the highest sensitivity (90.9%), specificity (96.0%) and diagnostic accuracy (95.1%) for the presence of cervical involvement. In 11 cases with cervical lesions, MRI predicted all 9 cases with invasion deeper than 1.5 mm. From these results we concluded that MRI appeared to be an excellent technique for cervical involvement and it would be a great help in determining the surgical procedure for endometrial cancer.
