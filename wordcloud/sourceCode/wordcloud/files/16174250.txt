abstract: The objective of the current study was to compare the results of surgical treatment in endometrial cancer with the use of laparoscopy and the traditional approach of laparotomy. Our goal was to evaluate and compare the morbidity, recurrence rate, and disease-free survival in both groups. This article is a retrospective study. A chart review of 45 patients treated by laparoscopy between 1994 and 2002 and 136 patients treated by laparotomy between 2001 and 2002 was performed. Disease-free survival in both groups was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and was compared using the log-rank test. The rate of recidive was 6% in the laparoscopy group and 13% in the laparotomy group. There was no statistically significant difference in disease-free survival and recidive rate between the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups. Laparoscopic management in endometrial cancer does not worsen the prognosis, and the disease-free survival is similar to that resulting from the traditional approach. The benefits of minimal invasive surgery are quicker postoperative recovery, shorter hospital stay, and no wound complications.
