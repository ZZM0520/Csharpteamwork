abstract: Study objective:To evaluate the usefulness of clinical, ultrasonographic, hysteroscopic, and immunohistochemical parameters in differentiating endometrial polyps from endometrial cancer.Design:Cross-sectional study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Setting:Tertiary public hospital, university teaching center.Patients:Eighty-two women who underwent hysteroscopic polypectomy and 20 women who underwent surgery to treat endometrial cancer.Interventions:Analysis of medical records and immunohistochemical assessment of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and endothelial markers CD34 and CD105.Measurements and main results:Among women with endometrial cancer and endometrial polyps, respectively, mean age was 63 and 57 years (p = .01), 89% and 67% were postmenopausal (p &lt; .05), and 85% and 30.5% had postmenopausal bleeding (p &lt; .01). No sonographic parameter enabled differentiation of endometrial polyp from cancer. Of patients with endometrial cancer, 72% exhibited signs suggestive of hyperplasia, and endometrial polyps were diagnosed during hysteroscopy. Estrogen receptors (≥ 2 vs ≥ 1; p &lt; .001) and progesterone receptors (≥ 3 vs ≥ 2; p = .07) were greater in endometrial polyps. There was no significant difference in microvessel density (p &gt; .05).Conclusions:Ultrasonographic parameters and endothelial markers did not enable differentiation of polyps from endometrial neoplasia. Postmenopausal bleeding and endometrial hypervascularization along with vascular atypia at diagnostic hysteroscopy showed a greater association with endometrial cancer.
