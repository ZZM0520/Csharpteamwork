abstract: Endometrial Cancer is the most common female genital tract malignancy, its pathogenesis is complex, not yet fully described. To identify key genes of Endometrial Cancer we downloaded the gene chip GSE17025 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through the GEO2R analysis tool. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis were performed for DEGs using DAVID database. The network of proteinâ€“protein-interaction (PPI) was established by STRING website and visualized by Cytoscape. Then, functional and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGS were performed by DAVID database. A total of 1000 significant differences genes were obtained, contain 362 up-regulated genes and 638 down-regulated genes. PCDH10, SLC6A2, OGN, SFRP4, TRH, ANGPTL, FOSB are down-regulated genes. The gene of IGH, CCL20, ELF5, LTF, ASPM expression level in tumor patients are up-regulated. Biological function of enrichment include metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, MAPK signaling pathway, Serotonergic synapse, Protein digestion and absorption, IL-17 signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway. All in all, the current study to determine endometrial differentially expressed genes and biological function, comprehensive analysis of intrauterine membrane carcinoma pathogenesis mechanism, and might be used as molecular targets and diagnostic biomarkers for the treatment of endometrial cancer.
