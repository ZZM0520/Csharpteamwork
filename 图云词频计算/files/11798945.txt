abstract: Objective:To study the difference in gene expression between normal endometrial tissue and endometrial cancer tissue so as to investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis of endometrial cancer.Methods:The tissues from 30 patients with endometrial cancer and normal endometrial tissues from the same patients were analyzed by cDNA microarray technology (including 588 genes). General RNA was extracted from these tissues and probes were made to be hybridized with cDNA array membrane. The CD147 expressions in normal endometrial tissue and in endometrial cancer tissue were identified by immunohistochemistry.Results:The endometrial cancer associated genes - IRP, Wnt-5A, 5T4 oncofetal antigen precursor, aggrecan core protein precursor, CD147, TIMP-2, were expressed highly.Conclusion:cDNA microarray technology can simultaneously monitor the different expressions of genes from two different tissues. CD147 might be useful in assessing the progression and infiltration of endometrial cancer.
