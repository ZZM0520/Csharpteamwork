abstract: Background:Endometrial cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm of the female reproductive organs. A dysfunctional endometrial renin-angiotensin system (RAS) might contribute to the growth and spread of endometrial cancer. The RAS-related gene polymorphisms, including the polymorphism of insertion/deletion (I/D) in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene, influence RAS activity.Objectives:In the present study, we examined the association between the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and endometrial cancer risk in Polish women.Material and methods:Genotype analysis of the ACE I/D polymorphism was carried out using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 142 endometrial cancer type 1 patients and 68 cancer-free subjects. The results of the analyses were correlated with clinical data.Results:The frequency of DD, DI and II ACE genotypes did not vary significantly between the experimental group and the control group (40 (28%), 61 (43%) and 41 (29%) vs 18 (26%), 31 (46%), and 19 (28%), respectively; p = 0.935). In addition, the incidence of the DD, DI and II polymorphisms in the ACE gene did not vary significantly between the experimental subgroups when stratified by cancer grade - G1, G2 and G3 endometrioid carcinoma - and the control group. Furthermore, the ACE polymorphism was not significantly associated with hypertension, diabetes or lymph node metastasis.Conclusions:The ACE I/D gene polymorphism was not associated with endometrial cancer risk or the clinicopathological features in Polish women.
