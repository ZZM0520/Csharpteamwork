abstract: Transvaginal US is often the initial imaging examination for women with dysfunctional (postmenopausal or intermenstrual) uterine bleeding. However, once the diagnosis of endometrial cancer has been made, contrast-enhanced MRI should be performed in patients who require multifactorial assessment (eg, depth of myometrial invasion, cervical involvement, lymph node metastasis). The results of contrast-enhanced MRI help distinguish patients who need more aggressive therapy and referral to a gynecologic oncologist from those who will do well treated by a community gynecologist.
