abstract: Objective:The role of lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer is still uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the survival outcomes of two different strategies in apparent uterine confined disease by comparing sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and selective lymphadenectomy (LD).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed women with preoperative stage I endometrial cancer underwent surgical staging with either SLN mapping, or LD in two Italian centers.Results:Eight hundred and two women underwent surgical staging for preoperative stage I endometrial cancer were revised (145 Monza; 657 Rome). All patients underwent peritoneal washing, simple hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and nodal staging including SLN mapping, or LD. Overall 8229 lymph nodes were removed (1595 in Monza, 6634 in Rome). Pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 33.1% and 52.4% in Monza and Rome, respectively (p&lt;0.001). Patients with positive pelvic LN were 16.7% and 7.3%, in SLN and LD groups, respectively (p=0.002). Disease-free survival (DFS) curves did not showed a statistically significant difference between centers and strategies adopted (SLN mapping, LD, SLN+LD) with a HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.63-2.16; p=0.475).Conclusions:Survival outcomes were similar for both strategies. The SLN strategy allowed to identify a higher rate of stage IIIC1 disease even with a lower median number of lymph node removed in SLN group. Applying a SLN algorithm does not impair the prognosis of endometrial cancer patients. The clinical impact and management of low volume metastasis in high-risk patients should be further clarify.
