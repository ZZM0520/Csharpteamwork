abstract: PURPOSE AND MATERIALS AND METHODS: Because of the inaccuracies in clinical staging of endometrial cancer, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) in 1988 changed the staging of endometrial cancer to surgical staging consisting of intraoperative findings and histologic evaluation of the specimen. A decade later, 1998, the United States Society of Gynecologic Oncologists published Practice Guidelines for the surgical staging of endometrial cancer. The purpose of this study was to review the use of lymph node sampling and peritoneal washings in 100 consecutive cases of clinical stage I endometrial cancer and compare these results to the Practice Guidelines of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists.Results:The vast majority of patients (86%) had peritoneal washings and frozen section (69%) of the uterus. However, only slightly more than half (52%) had palpitation of the pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes. Most encouraging and consistent with the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists' Guidelines is that 87% of the patients with histologically more aggressive cancers (grade III or deep myometrial invasion), had lymph node sampling as did 90.5% with more aggressive histologic subtypes.Conclusion:Notwithstanding these results, there is still the need in the 21st century for more uniform guidelines for the surgical staging of endometrial cancer.
