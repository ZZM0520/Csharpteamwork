abstract: Background:Lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer is 2.17%. There is controversy regarding the predictive value of Cancer Antigen 125 (CA125) in endometrial cancer as well as the significance of its relationship with prognostic factors and appropriate cut-off value.Objective:The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic role of CA125 in advanced endometrial carcinoma and determination of the appropriate cut-off value.Methods:A sample of 91 patients was retrospectively selected from a population of 501 patients suffering from endometrial cancer during 1995 to 2015 in accordance with the inclusion criteria. The relation between clinicopathological variables and CA125 were analyzed. In order to determine sensitivity and specificity of various cut-off levels, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for associated factors confirmed by logistic regression analysis.Results:In 35% of patients, CA125 values were 35 u/ml, and in 52%, the values were equal to or greater than 20 u/ml. High preoperative CA125 was significantly related with advanced stage, ovarian involvement, omental metastasis, and myometrial invasion equal to or greater than 50%. According to the ROC curve, the suitable cut-off value for CA125 in advanced stage (sensitivity = 73%, specificity = 55%, positive predictive value = 18%, negative predictive value = 78%) and myometrial invasion equal to or greater than 50% (sensitivity = 64%, specificity = 61%, positive predictive value = 47%, negative predictive value = 74%) was 20 u/ml. Further, the suitable cut-off value for CA125 in involvement of the ovaries (sensitivity = 77%, specificity = 72%, positive predictive value = 31%, negative predictive value = 95%) and omental involvement (sensitivity = 70%, specificity = 70%, positive predictive value = 22%, negative predictive value = 95%) was 35 u/ml.Conclusions:In endometrial carcinoma, due to the relationship of CA125 with numerous prognostic factors, it is recommended that CA125 measurement be included in preoperative evaluation. In case of high CA125 levels, complete surgical staging including lymphadenectomy and omentectomy should be considered.
