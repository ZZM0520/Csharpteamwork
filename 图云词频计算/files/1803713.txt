abstract: The authors reviewed 2007 consecutive outpatient hysteroscopies performed in self-referred women to assess the detection rate of uterine cancer and the validity of different selection criteria for hysteroscopy. Thirty cases of uterine cancer (29 endometrial, 1 carcinosarcoma) were detected. Abnormal uterine bleeding was the indication most commonly associated with cancer (26 of 30 cases, cancer detection rate = 2.1%), whereas the presence of cervical polyps had no predictive value. Patients age was correlated to cancer detection rate, and the investigation of uterine cancer under the age of 45 was poorly cost effective. Hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy, performed by Permacurette or Novak curette immediately after hysteroscopy, missed respectively 8 and 2 of 30 cancers. Hysteroscopy should be employed in combination with endometrial biopsy as a standard outpatient investigation whenever endometrial cancer is suspected. These procedures are safe and accurate and rule out more aggressive and costly procedures, such as dilatation and curettage, in most cases.
