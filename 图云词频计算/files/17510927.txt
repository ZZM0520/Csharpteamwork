abstract: Background:The study compared tumor characteristics and survival in women with breast cancer who subsequently developed endometrial cancer with or without a history of tamoxifen use.Methods:The British Columbia Cancer Agency registry identified 163 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1989-1999 who received a subsequent diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Of these, 55% (n = 90) had a history of tamoxifen use. Outcomes analyzed were breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), endometrial cancer-specific survival (ECSS), and overall survival (OS).Results:Median follow-up was 9.4 years. Distributions of age, menopausal status, body mass index, and comorbidities were similar in the tamoxifen-treated and nontamoxifen cohorts. Proportions of aggressive endometrial cancer subtypes including papillary serous, clear cell, and mixed mullerian tumors were higher in the tamoxifen cohort (28% vs14%, P = .03). Distributions of endometrial cancer grade and stage were similar in the 2 groups (P &gt; .05). Hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy were the primary treatments for endometrial cancer in 99% of patients, with comparable pelvic control rates in the tamoxifen and nontamoxifen groups. At 10 years, patients in the tamoxifen group experienced lower BCSS compared with the nontamoxifen group (89% vs 97%, P = .02). No significant differences in ECSS and OS were observed between the 2 groups (ECSS 82% and 82%, P = .85; and OS 69% v. 66%, P = .85).Conclusions:In patients with breast cancer who developed a subsequent endometrial cancer, tamoxifen-treated patients had higher proportions of aggressive endometrial cancer subtypes, but almost all cases were amenable to surgery, thus resulting in similar endometrial cancer control and survival when compared with nontamoxifen treated patients.
