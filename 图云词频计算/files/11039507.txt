abstract: Recent reports have suggested that the pathologic features of young patients with endometrial cancer are less favorable than previously thought. We retrospectively reviewed the characteristics and outcome of young patients with endometrial cancer at our institution. A total of 457 surgically staged patients were divided in 2 groups: Group A (age &lt; or =45 years, n = 41) and B (age &gt;45, n = 416). Groups A and B had a similar distribution of tumor stage, grade, histology, lymphovascular invasion, synchronous ovarian primaries, and positive cytology. Although group A tumors had less myometrial invasion (MI) (p = 0.004) and were lower grade (p = 0.06), a trend to more frequent nodal involvement was seen in group A women (p = 0.09). Adverse pathologic features, in particular deep MI, were more common in group A patients older than age 40. Group A patients had a disease-free (p = 0.56) and cause-specific (p = (0.26) survival that was similar to that of group B patients. Young patients with endometrial cancer have a distribution of most pathologic features and equivalent outcome similar to that of older women. However, adverse features are not equally distributed in young women. A discordance may also exist between MI, grade, and nodal involvement.
