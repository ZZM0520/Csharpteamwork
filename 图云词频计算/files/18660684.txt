abstract: Purpose of review:By the current review we aim to describe different options for laparoscopic hysterectomy in patients with endometrial cancer and discuss the reported risk factors and limitations of laparoscopic hysterectomy in surgical staging of endometrial cancer.Recent findings:Laparoscopic techniques and equipment have matured over the last 15 years and are now widely used to treat patients with endometrial cancer, thereby potentially reducing perioperative morbidity and postoperative pain, and providing shorter hospital stay, faster recovery and improved quality of life compared with the corresponding open procedures. However, some risk factors are postulated to limit the use of laparoscopic hysterectomy in staging of endometrial cancer.Summary:Surgical staging of endometrial cancer by laparoscopic hysterectomy is feasible and well tolerated. This surgical approach does not seem to affect recurrence and overall survival rates. Limitations of laparoscopic hysterectomy in management of endometrial cancer need to be evaluated.
