abstract: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer, and with a median age of 62 at diagnosis, it affects a significant number of older women. With increasing age and obesity rates in the world's population, there is an anticipated concomitant increase in older women with endometrial cancer. Older women are more likely to die of endometrial cancer compared with younger patients. Reasons for this include more aggressive tumor biology, less favorable clinicopathologic features, and more advanced disease. Other factors, however, such as reluctance to offer surgical treatment to the older patient and increased complications of treatment are likely to be important. Management of endometrial cancer requires multidisciplinary care (surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapy). For each treatment, the feasibility (related to technical aspect of the procedure/treatment), side effects and safety (related to older-patient factors), and the overall benefit as it pertains to older women with endometrial cancer should be assessed carefully with a multidisciplinary approach. Despite the importance of these issues, the data are limited to answer these issues with clarity. In this article, we will review each treatment modality for older women with endometrial cancer. We will introduce the components of comprehensive geriatric assessment and their practical implication for older women with cancer in general and older women with endometrial cancer specifically.
