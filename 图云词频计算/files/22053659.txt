abstract: Background:Endometrial cancer is one of the most common malignant neoplasms which appear in the uterine body. X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) protein can be involved in the repair of DNA lesions, which are known to contribute to endometrial cancer.Material and methods:The genotype analysis of XRCC1 Arg399Gln gene polymorphisms for 456 endometrial cancer patients and 300 controls of cancer-free subjects in the Polish population were performed using the PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).Results:The association between endometrial cancer occurrence and the Gln/Gln genotype of the Arg399Gln polymorphism (odds ratio, OR 2.28; 95% confidence interval, CI 2.02-2.54) was found. The Gln/Gln genotype of XRCC1 increased the risk of type I endometrial cancer occurrence (OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 2.12-2.72). No statistically significant association was found between gene polymorphisms and endometrial cancer risk factors such as BMI, HRT, uterine bleeding, endometrial ultrasound transvaginal, diabetes and hypertension.Conclusion:The results support the hypothesis that the Arg399Gln polymorphism of the XRCC1 gene may be associated with the incidence of sporadic endometrial cancer in Polish women.
