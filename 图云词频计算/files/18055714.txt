abstract: Objective:To evaluate whether C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels are associated with prognosis in surgically treated endometrial cancer.Methods:In the present multicenter study, CRP serum levels were measured preoperatively in 403 surgically staged patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer. Results were correlated to clinical data.Results:The mean (standard deviation) serum CRP level in patients with endometrial cancer was 1.0 (1.8) mg/dL. Serum CRP levels were associated with tumor stage (P=.01), but not with tumor grade (P=.8), lymph node involvement (P=.8), and age at diagnosis (P=.9). In a univariable survival analysis, serum CRP levels, tumor stage, tumor grade, and age at diagnosis were associated with disease-free and overall survival (all P &lt;.001). In a multivariable Cox regression model, serum CRP levels (P=.001, P=.004), tumor stage (P &lt;.001, P &lt;.001), tumor grade (P=.02, P=.009), and age at diagnosis (P=.002, P=.001) were independent prognostic factors for disease-free and overall survival.Conclusion:Our results suggest that elevated serum CRP levels are associated with a less favorable prognosis in patients with surgically treated endometrial cancer.Level of evidence:II.
