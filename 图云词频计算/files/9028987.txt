abstract: The role of surgery in the treatment of patients with invasive cervical cancer is undisputed, but how radical surgery should be is debatable. Every case requires detailed knowledge of the development and spread of cervical cancer. Tumor volume is the most important diagnostic factor in cervical cancer and also correlates with vascular invasion and lymph node involvement. As radical hysterectomy requires in cervical cancer besides the laparoscopically easy performable lymphadenectomy also the resection of parametria with sceletonisation of ureters we started to treat endometrial cancer with a combined laparoscopic and vaginal approach. In patients with the suspicion of stage I endometrial cancer prior to laparoscopic staging, the prerequisites of histological grading with ploidy and measurement of monoclonal antibodies were performed. All patients underwent a general check with radiography, computer tomography, liver scan, bone scan and lymphography. The performance of lymphadenectomy in cases of stage I endometrial cancer remains a controversial subject. We believe that laparoscopic assisted surgical staging of stage I endometrial cancer is an attractive alternative to the traditional laparotomy-surgical approach. The change from laparotomy to a laparoscopic assisted vaginal approach allows for a similar success rate with the less invasive approach. No complications occurred in this series and the results of our pilot study were satisfactory.
