abstract: The presence of the positive replication errors (RER) phenotype in familial and multiple primary malignancies of endometrial cancer, and its association with a poor prognosis was examined. We analyzed 40 endometrial cancers for RER. Eight endometrial cancers with the RER(+) phenotype at multiple microsatellite loci were detected. The presence of the RER(+) phenotype was higher than in non-familial malignancies. None of the eight cases with the RER(+) phenotype involved multiple primary malignancies; however these patients had shorter survival times. In this study, we suggest that RER examination in endometrial cancer may be useful for establishing a diagnosis of a familial malignancy, and for predicting a poor prognosis.
