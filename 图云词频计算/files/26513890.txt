abstract: Endometrial carcinoma is the fourth most common cancer in U.K. women. Previous literature describes local, haematological or lymphatic dissemination to common sites including vaginal vault, lungs, liver, bones and brain. The authors present two unusual cases of endometrial cancer metastases to the psoas major muscle and laparoscopic port sites. Case 1 involves a 71-year-old female who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and peritoneal washings (TAH, BSO, PW) for Grade 1 endometrial cancer, Stage lB. Three years later she represented with lower back and right hip pain, with MRI imaging revealing psoas muscle metastases. Case 2 describes a 60-year-old female who underwent laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH), BSO+ PW for Grade 1 endometrial cancer, Stage 1B. Three years postoperatively she presented with a lateral abdominal mass overlying the laparoscopic port site scar, which was Grade 1 endometrial cancer on biopsy. These rare metastatic locations question our traditional understanding of the pathophysiology of endometrial carcinoma.
