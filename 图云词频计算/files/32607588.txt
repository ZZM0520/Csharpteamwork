abstract: Objective:To evaluate the feasibility, safety and surgical outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of low-risk endometrial cancer.Methods:Of 155 patients with low-risk endometrial cancer, who were included in this retrospective study between May 2008 and March 2017, 82 and 73 underwent laparoscopic and open surgery, respectively. Clinicopathological and surgical data, recurrence-free survival and overall survival were analyzed.Results:No statistically significant differences in median age, final pathological type, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and lymphovascular space involvement were observed between the laparoscopic and open surgery groups. No procedure in the laparoscopic surgery group was converted to open surgery. The median follow-up period was 60 months, with oncologic recurrence identified in three cases (one lung carcinoma and two pelvic cavity carcinomas) in the laparoscopic surgery group. There was no significant between-group difference in 5-year recurrence-free survival (laparoscopic surgery group: 96.3%, open surgery group: 92.6%) and overall survival (laparoscopic surgery group: 100%, open surgery group: 95.4%).Conclusions:Laparoscopic surgery is a feasible and safe treatment for endometrial cancer and should be considered as a standard treatment option for low-risk endometrial cancer.
