abstract: Endometrial cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignant neoplasms among women. In Poland, it is in the fourth place in terms of incidence. The highest morbidity concerns women aged 50-70 years, however it may also appear in women in their reproductive period. Endometrial cancer concerns about 3% of premenopausal women. We present a case of a 25-year-old patient who underwent endometrial curettage because of irregular menstrual bleeding for the last 5 months. Histopathology revealed endometrial cancer. We attempted to apply a conservative treatment. During the next 6 months the patient was treated with lynestrenol. After one month of hormonal therapy endometrial curettage was repeated. In histopathology endometrial tissues corresponding to the hormonal treatment were found. After 6 months of treatment hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy followed by endometrial curettage, were performed. Hormonal treatment resulted in disease regression. About 5 months after successful treatment the patient conceived spontaneously. One year after she gave birth to her first child, she conceived spontaneously once more. Both children were born vaginally. In selected cases of atypical hyperplasia and early endometrial cancer in young women the attempt of hormonal treatment is acceptable.
