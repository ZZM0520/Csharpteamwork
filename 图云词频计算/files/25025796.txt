abstract: Available data on appropriate follow-up in endometrial cancer highlight the need of well-conducted studies. Most recurrences tend to occur within three years and involve symptoms. Routine tests are not advocated without symptoms. In case of suspicious recurrence, TEP/CT seems to be the most sensitive and specific method. There is limited evidence to decide whether follow-up schedules with multiple visits result in survival benefits. An appropriate follow-up should be discussed based upon the risk of recurrence. Counselling on the potential symptoms of recurrence should be a major aim.
