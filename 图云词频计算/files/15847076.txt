abstract: Objectives:The aim of study was to analyse results of treatment patients with uterine-confined endometrial cancer which underwent surgery and postoperative radiotherapy in Center of Oncology in Krak√≥w between 1985 and 1997.Material and methods:The research included a group of 650 women. All patients undergo total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and postoperative radiotherapy. 155 patients with intermediate-risk of recurrence (IA-G3, IB-G1, G2) received postoperative whole pelvic irradiation only. In the group of 495 patients with high-risk of recurrence (IB-G3, IC, II) 210 patients received brachytherapy vaginal cuff only and 285 patients whole pelvic and vaginal cuff irradiation.Results:In the group of patients with intermediate-risk of recurrence five NED survival was 93.5%. In the group of patients with high-risk of recurrence five NED survival was statistically lower in patients treated with brachytherapy vaginal cuff only (83.2% vs. 71.9%).Conclusion:In uterine-confined endometrial cancer patients, with intermediate-risk of recurrence treated with surgery and postoperative whole pelvis irradiation, 5-year NED survival is above of 90%. In the group of patients with high-risk of recurrence the adjuvant treatment of choice is whole pelvic and vaginal cuff irradiation.
