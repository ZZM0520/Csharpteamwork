abstract: Preoperative assessment requires only endometrial sampling for diagnosis. Curettage is needed when endometrial sampling is unsatisfactory. Transvaginal ultrasonography may be useful in screening high-risk patients, as well as in assessing myoinvasion or cervical extension. Postsurgical pathologic prognostic factor analysis is most accurate in assigning risk for recurrence. Once the extent of disease is confirmed by the surgical staging procedure of hysterectomy, bilateral removal of the ovaries, and selective pelvic and periaortic node dissection, adjunctive therapy can be considered. Patients with low-risk stage IA and IB grade 1 disease require hysterectomy and removal of the adnexa. The poorer prognosis of patients with grade 2 or 3 histologic features in stages IB to IIB dictates considerations for adjunctive therapy. Soon randomized controlled trials will elucidate objectively what may be optimal adjunctive therapy. Ongoing prospective trials will clarify the role of operative laparoscopy. Current management guidelines are based on independent prognostic factors derived from analysis of surgicopathologic studies.
