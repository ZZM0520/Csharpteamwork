abstract: Objective:We sought to evaluate the outcomes and feasibility associated with delivering sequential chemotherapy and radiation in advanced stage endometrial cancer.Methods:We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients treated at the University of Minnesota with sequential chemotherapy and radiation for advanced stage endometrial cancer from 1999 to 2007. Inclusion criteria were endometrial cancer patients treated with comprehensive surgical staging followed by adjuvant therapy consisting of sequential chemotherapy, radiation, and consolidation chemotherapy in a "sandwich" fashion. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated by Kaplan-Meier (KM) method.Results:Twenty-three patients met entry criteria and were included in the analysis. The median age was 57 years (range 28-78). The majority of patients were stage III (78%) and the most common histologic type was serous (52%). The combination of a taxane and carboplatin was administered in 100% of cases. All planned cycles of chemotherapy were completed (100%) with the majority being prescribed six cycles (82%). Of the 23 patients, 5 progressed of which 3 died during the follow up period. The KM estimate of 1, 3, and 5 year PFS is 100%, 80%, and 74%, respectively. The KM estimate for 1, 3, and 5 year OS is 100%, 88% and 79%, respectively.Conclusion:Adjuvant therapy delivered in a "sandwich" fashion was feasible, well-tolerated and resulted in excellent long-term progression free and overall survival. A prospective study is currently ongoing at our institution.
