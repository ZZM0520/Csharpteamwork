abstract: Objective:To evaluate the significance of postoperative inflammatory system response markers in predicting the prognosis of patients with endometrial cancer undergoing surgery.Methods:The present retrospective study included patients who underwent surgical treatment for pathology-confirmed endometrial cancer between January 1, 2007, and June 30, 2013, at the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China. Potential prognostic factors were investigated by Cox proportional hazards analysis and survival rates were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses.Results:There were 185 patients with surgically treated endometrial cancer included. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that a preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) above 1.81 (P=0.010) and a postoperative NLR above 7.54 (P=0.008) were both independently associated with lower disease free survival. Elevated preoperative and postoperative NLRs were associated with higher tumor stage (P=0.021 and P=0.009, respectively), and only elevated preoperative NLR was associated with lymph node involvement (P=0.023).Conclusion:Preoperative and postoperative NLRs were independently associated with inflammatory system response markers and could be combined to evaluate the prognosis of patients with endometrial cancer following surgery.
