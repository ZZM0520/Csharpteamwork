abstract: Uterine endometrial cancer is associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with advanced-stage disease. Here, we developed a three-dimensional cell cultivation method of endometrioid cancer stem-like cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity from clinical specimens. ALDH inhibition synergized with paclitaxel to block cancer proliferation. In the clinical setting, high ALDH1A1 expression was associated with poor survival. A high level of ALDH correlated with an increase of glucose uptake, activation of the glycolytic pathway, and elevation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Blockade of GLUT1 inhibited characteristics of cancer stem cells. Similarly to ALDH inhibition, GLUT1 inhibition synergized with paclitaxel to block endometrial cancer proliferation. Our data indicated that ALDH-dependent GLUT1 activation and the resulting glycolytic activation are of clinical importance for both prognostic evaluation and therapeutic decision-making in endometrial cancer patients. In addition, the synergistic effects of taxane compounds and ALDH or GLUT1 inhibitors may serve as a new clinical treatment option for endometrial cancer.
