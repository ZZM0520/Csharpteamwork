abstract: Aim:Determination of the correlation of the assessment of depth of invasion in endometrial cancer by transvaginal ultrasound, and by intraoperative assessment with histopathology.Method:In this study 25 patients with endometrial cancer diagnosed by dilatation and curettage were examined by means of transvaginal ultrasound. The sonographically assessed depth of invasion (inner or outer half of the uterus wall) was compared with the intraoperatively determined depth of invasion in the sectioned uterus. Finally, we correlated these findings with histopathology.Results:Transvaginal ultrasound and the intraoperative assessment of depth of invasion had and accuracy of 80% if correlated with the definitive histopathology. The result of the frozen section was correct in all analysed cases. We also evaluated the wrong assessments in the ultrasound group and in those patients who were assessed intraoperatively. In all these cases there were additional pathological findings, such as polyps, fibroids and uterus retroflexus.Conclusion:We conclude that especially in such cases frozen section analyses yield helpful information on the depth of invasion and should be performed routinely.
