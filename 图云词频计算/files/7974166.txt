abstract: Purpose:Divergent opinions exist on the value of adjuvant treatment in endometrial cancer. This paper aims at clarifying the indications for adjuvant radiotherapy by reviewing the literature and presenting own data.Methods:For endometrial cancer 5-year survival data are analysed with respect to the value of adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemo-/hormone therapy.Results:Adjuvant radiotherapy in FIGO stage I and II tumors reduces pelvic recurrence rates from 15 to 20% to 1 to 5%. In high risk stage I patients the 5-year survival rate is increased by 30 to 40% using pre-operative high dose endocavitary brachytherapy or postoperative external beam therapy. In stage II disease the 5-year survival rate is increased to 60 to 80% when applying 50 to 60 Gy post surgery. In stage III and IV tumors primary radiotherapy results in 5-year survival rates of 16 to 40%.Conclusions:In stage I and II endometrial cancer primary treatment consists of surgery followed by radiotherapy in eligible cases. In stage III and IV tumors primary radiotherapy is generally advocated. No properly randomized trials are available to date on the value of adjuvant treatment. There is a great demand for such trials in order to confirm the available data. According to the extent of the disease and the discrimination of certain risk groups these trials should include external beam pelvic irradiation, brachytherapy, para-aortic irradiation as well as systemic chemo-or hormone therapy.
