abstract: Objective:We analyzed the effect of lymphadenectomy on the use of adjuvant radiation treatment for women with stage I-II endometrial cancer.Study design:Women with stage I-II endometrioid adenocarcinomas treated between 1988 and 2006 and recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database were identified. The influence of lymphadenectomy (LND) on receipt of external beam radiation and brachytherapy stratified was examined.Results:We identified 58,776 women including 26,043 who underwent LND (44.3%). Among women younger than 60 years of age with stage IA (grades 1, 2, and 3) tumors, LND had no impact on the use of radiation. Patients with stage IB (grade 2 or 3) and stage IC (grade 1 or 2) tumors who underwent lymph node dissection were less likely to undergo external beam radiation and more likely to receive vaginal brachytherapy (P &lt; .05 for all). Furthermore, the extent of lymphadenectomy influenced the receipt of radiation.Conclusion:Women who undergo lymphadenectomy are less likely to receive whole pelvic radiotherapy.
