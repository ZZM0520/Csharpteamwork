abstract: Due to advances of radiological imaging and tumor biomarkers, the extent of information provided by preoperative assessment is rapidly growing. The Korean Gynecologic Oncology Group (KGOG) recently proposed new preoperative criteria to identify patients at low risk for lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer. In the multicenter study, serum carbohydrate antigen 125 levels and three magnetic resonance imaging parameters were found to be independent risk factors for nodal metastasis, and classified 53% of patients as part of a low-risk group. The false-negative predictive value (NPV) was 1.7%, and was 1.4% in the validation set. Furthermore, the KGOG low-risk criteria were validated in 319 Japanese patients with endometrial cancer. The criteria identified 181 of 319 patients as a low-risk group (51%), and three false-negative cases were found (1.9%). These results indicate that we are able to identify low-risk patients with a negligible NPV before surgery. In addition, the low false NPV implies that there is great difficulty in performing a randomized trial to determine the efficacy of routine lymphadenectomy in patients at low risk of lymph node metastasis. Based on these data, the challenges and possible solutions for developing a consensus on the optimized management of low-risk endometrial cancer will be discussed in this review.
