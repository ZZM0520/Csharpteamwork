abstract: Introduction:Morbid obesity may lead to difficulties for management of endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was the assessment of management of endometrial cancer for morbidly obese women and the implementation of recommendations.Methods:this is retrospective study including women with BMI =40kg/m<sup>2</sup> treated for endometrial cancer between November 2010 and April 2017 in the university hospital in Nantes and the Cancer Center Ren√© Gauducheau in Nantes. Patients' demographics, pre-operative intra operative, post-operative data and survival were analyzed.Results:Twenty patients met the inclusion criteria with a median age of 65.5 (28-86) and a median BMI of 47kg/m<sup>2</sup> (40-60). Type I histologic was identified in 90% and of a stage I FIGO I in 75% of the cases. All the patients have benefited from a biopsy of endometrium before surgery. 70% of the patients have benefited from a MRI before surgery (14/20). The surgery was realized by laparotomy in 40%, by mini invasive surgery in 50% and by vaginal procedure in 10% of. Mini invasive surgery was converted in laparotomy in 40% (4/10). A discrepancy of the ESMO's recommandation was observed in 40% of the cases (8/20). Two patients did not benefit from the adjuvant radiotherapy recommended because of delay of healing.Discussion:Although good prognosis, the endometrial cancer of morbidly obese women seem to be under treat. These patients do not seem benefited an optimal pre-operative assessment. The surgery is mainly realized by laparotomy with a not complete surgical stadification for one more than a third of the patients.
