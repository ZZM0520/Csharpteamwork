abstract: It has become clear that aberrant gene expression, via alterations in promoter methylation or histone acetylation, is a contributing factor for carcinogenesis, perhaps as important as genetic mutation. This is particularly evident in endometrial cancer, in which multiple genes are silenced through hypermethylation. In this review, we discuss the field of epigenetics and relevant techniques to characterize methylation and acetylation alterations. The CpG island methylator phenotype, epimutations and the effects of aging on methylation are also discussed. In endometrial cancer there is evidence that hypermethylation of relevant genes can be reversed using epigenetic inhibitors, resulting in re-expression of silenced genes. Preliminary data also suggest that a panel of methylation biomarkers could be useful for diagnosis and even screening in selected populations at high risk. This disease is particularly well suited for such a strategy given that the endometrium is readily accessible for testing and endometrial cancer precursors are well defined.
