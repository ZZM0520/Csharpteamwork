abstract: Background/aims:To review the literature and compare detection rates, false negative (FN) rates, and negative predictive values (NPVs) of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in endometrial cancer to those in breast and vulvar cancer. Secondary objectives were to evaluate techniques of SLN biopsy in endometrial cancer.Methods:The PubMed database was searched for applicable scientific articles. Detection rates, FN rates, and NPVs were calculated for all studies. Studies were stratified by techniques and compared.Results:Nineteen articles met criteria for this review. The overall detection rates ranged from 62 to 100%, the FN rate ranged from 0 to 50%, and the NPVs ranged from 95 to 100%. There is no technique that is definitively superior to any other with regard to surgical modality, injectant used, injection site, or pathologic techniques.Conclusions:Studies on SLN biopsy in endometrial cancer have a large range of detection rates and FN rates, and larger studies including more patients with metastatic disease are needed for comparison with breast and vulvar cancers. While no techniques are definitively superior to others, minimally invasive surgery, cervical injection, and pathologic analysis utilizing HE staining, immunohistochemistry, and ultrastaging may be clinically advantageous.
