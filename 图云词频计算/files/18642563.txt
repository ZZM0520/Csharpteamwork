abstract: Aim:Our aim was to combine the use of progesterone challenge test and TVS for the women from the risky groups with diabetes mellitus (120), obesity (120) blood hypertension (120) and the women with combined risky factors (120). We wanted to find precancer and cancer of the endometrium in these asymptomatic women.Material and methods:We evaluated 480 women for the period of 1995-2007. We applied progesterone challenge test and TVS. When we used progesterone test one asymptomatic patients is turned into symptomatic and when bleeding occurred we performed D&amp;C.Results:We found 15 women with endometrial cancer and 40 women with atypical glandular hyperplasia for the period from 1995-2007.Conclusions:The combination of TVS and progesterone test can be used as a screening method for early finding and screening of endometrial precancer and cancer in women with risky factors.
