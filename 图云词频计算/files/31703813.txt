abstract: Early endometrial cancer has an overall survival of greater than 80% (1). One of the poor prognostic factors that may be associated with the 20% who do not survive 5 years is the presence of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI). LVSI is associated with increased nodal metastasis and decreased progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (2-8). Therefore, unstaged, LVSI positive early endometrial cancer requires additional management with either completion of staging with lymphadenectomy or adjuvant radiation. We focus on reviewing the management of natural history and management of early endometrial cancer followed by the prognostic impact of LVSI, management options and recommendations.
