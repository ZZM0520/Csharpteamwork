abstract: Background:Definitive management with hysterectomy could be appropriate for some patients with endometrial cancer and its precursor lesions, but poses challenges for those desiring future fertility.Objectives:To review risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia/cancer among premenopausal women and discuss management options for fertility preservation.Search strategy:A literature search through the PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane databases was conducted using the terms "endometrial hyperplasia" and "endometrial cancer," cross-referenced with "fertility preservation."Selection criteria:All articles published in English between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2015, were considered if they were readily available online.Data collection and analysis:Articles were analyzed and information was synthesized into a comprehensive review.Main results:Chronic anovulation, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus must be appreciated as risk factors for endometrial pathology. Providers must exert vigilance in identifying patients at risk and in initiating pre-emptive strategies. Risk reduction with lifestyle modification, weight loss, and glycemic control can improve regression and overall health. Fertility outcomes for these patients are promising, especially with assisted reproductive technology.Conclusions:Conservative management could be appropriate for carefully selected women with complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia or early-stage endometrial cancer who desire future fertility.
