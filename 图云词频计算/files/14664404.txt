abstract: Endometrial cancer is today the first ranking malignancy of the female genital tract in civilized countries. We stress the importance of screening and an early accurate diagnosis with personalized therapy. Personalized therapy is particularly important considering that there are two main forms of these neoplasms: the endometrioid form, hormonodependent and with a good prognosis, and a serous autonomous form, which has a poor evolution. Studying the cases in the Ist Clinic of Gynecology, Timi≈üoara, we analyzed the incidence of these forms, their particularities and diagnostic possibilities.
