abstract: The main aim of investigating women with abnormal uterine bleeding is to exclude serious intrauterine pathology, particularly endometrial cancer. Endometrial assessment has traditionally been achieved by obtaining tissue for histological analysis utilising blind in-patient dilatation of the cervix and curettage of the endometrium under general anaesthesia. This procedure is now generally accepted as outmoded practice associated with unnecessary morbidity and cost and has been largely replaced by minimally invasive out-patient or 'ambulatory' diagnostic modalities. These modalities include transvaginal ultrasonography, out-patient hysteroscopy and miniature endometrial biopsy. The most controversial debate has centred on how best to image the uterine cavity with advocates of hysteroscopy and ultrasonography holding apparently implacable views. However, the concept of hysteroscopy and ultrasonography as competing tests may be misplaced, and perhaps they should be viewed as complementary diagnostic tools. To help us answer such questions requires an appraisal of the available evidence. In this way, a more rational approach to investigating women for endometrial cancer is possible based on the clinical and economic performance of hysteroscopy and ultrasonography. This review assesses the evidence and suggests approaches available to gynaecologists for the diagnostic work-up of women suspected to have endometrial cancer utilising hysteroscopy and ultrasonography.
