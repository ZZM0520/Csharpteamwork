abstract: Purpose:We aimed to evaluate weather survival is impaired in stage IIIC endometrial cancer patients treated with minimally invasive surgery as compared to laparotomy.Methods:We analyzed surgical data and oncologic outcome of histologically proven stage IIIC endometrial cancer patients who were treated at our institution via laparotomy or via laparoscopic surgery. All the patients underwent a systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy and a complete tumor resection. Perioperative morbidity and overall survival of the patients subjected to the two surgical approaches were compared.Results:Sixty-six patients with stage IIIC endometrial cancer were identified. Of these, 15 patients were operated via laparotomy and 51 via laparoscopy. The two groups were similar with regards to median age at diagnosis, BMI, histotype, number of affected lymph nodes, and median maximal diameter of the affected lymph nodes. Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery had fewer perioperative complications, a smaller estimated blood loss, and were subjected less frequently to transfusions. Overall survival at 60 months of follow-up did not differ between the two groups. At uni- and multivariate analysis, surgical approach did not affect survival. Only age was a variable associated with overall survival.Conclusions:Minimally invasive surgery has better perioperative outcomes and does not impair survival in stage IIIC endometrial cancer patients. Age at diagnosis is the only factor independently affecting survival.
