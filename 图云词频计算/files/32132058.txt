abstract: Background/aim:This study aimed to determine whether a pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PPAL) improves survival compared with a pelvic lymphadenectomy (PL) in patients with endometrial cancer.Patients and methods:Data from all women operated for endometrial cancer between 1998 and 2013 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Women treated with PL were matched with those treated with PPAL according to age and risk of recurrence. The primary endpoint was disease-specific survival (DSS).Results:A total of 1015 patients who underwent PL were matched with 1015 patients who underwent PPAL. The 3-year DSS probabilities for patients at intermediate- and high-risk (IHR) of recurrence were similar in the PPAL group and the PL group. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors indicated that in patients with an IHR of recurrence, PPAL did not reduce the risk of death compared with PL.Conclusion:For patients with an IHR of recurrence, the extent of lymphadenectomy does not impact DSS.
