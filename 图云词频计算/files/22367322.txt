abstract: Objective:To compare the prognostic values of the 1988 and 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classifications for endometrial cancer.Materials and methods:From 1990 to 2008, patients undergoing surgery for endometrial cancer were extracted from the French prospective "Etude Epidémiologique auprès de femmes de l'Education Nationale" cohort study. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) an available detailed histologic report of primary surgical procedure and (2) available cause and date of death. Concordance indexes for the 1988 and 2009 FIGO classifications were compared.Results:Three hundred ninety-seven patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The concordance index for the 2009 FIGO classification was lower than that of the 1988 FIGO classification (0.76 vs 0.77, respectively).Conclusion:In this study, the 1988 FIGO classification for endometrial cancer is at least as accurate as the 2009 FIGO classification for predicting endometrial cancer mortality.
