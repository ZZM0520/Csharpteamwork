abstract: Objective:To increase discussion about obesity and endometrial cancer and referrals to weight loss clinic in patients with newly diagnosed low-risk endometrial cancer.Methods:A multidisciplinary team used a quality improvement methodology to increase patient awareness about obesity and endometrial cancer. Target population included patients &lt;80 years old with a body mass index â‰¥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who underwent surgery at our institution and had a final diagnosis of complex hyperplasia or stage I, grade 1-2 endometrioid endometrial cancer. A toolkit was developed for the intervention. Clinical characteristics, discussion about obesity, and referrals to a weight loss clinic were abstracted for a historic and intervention cohort. Data for the two cohorts were compared using chi-square, Fisher's exact test, and t-test.Results:54 patients from the historic cohort and 53 from the intervention cohort met inclusion criteria. Clinical characteristics were balanced between the groups. Discussion about obesity increased from 11.1% (6/54) to 79.2% (42/53) after implementing the toolkit (p<i>&lt;</i>0.001). Referrals to the weight loss clinic also increased from 3.7% (2/54) to 26.4% (14/53) after implementing the toolkit (p=0.001), but in both groups only 50% of those referred actually attended the weight loss clinic. No clinical characteristics were identified as associated with being more likely to have documented conversations or referrals.Conclusions:A multidisciplinary quality-improvement project can be used to increase discussion about obesity and referral to a weight loss clinic in patients with low-risk endometrial cancer. Increasing patient awareness of the connection between obesity and endometrial cancer may have implications on the long-term health of endometrial cancer survivors.
