abstract: Explain the important role of plasma D-dimer in cancers. Plasma D-dimer is increased in various tumors. However, the predictive value of plasma D-dimer is unclear. This study is aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the D-dimer level in patients managed with intensity-modulated radiation for endometrial cancer. The D-dimer levels of forty patients with endometrial cancer were assessed before (D1) and after (D2) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), respectively. The D-dimer level changes (ΔD) were defined as D2 minus D1. Cox regression and log-rank tests were used to evaluate the D-dimer levels in relation to progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The OS and PFS of patients with a low D1 were significantly longer than those with a high D1 (P&lt; 0.001, P&lt; 0.001). We saw the similar correlation between D2, PFS and OS (P&lt; 0.001, P&lt; 0.001). Multivariate survival analyses showed that D-dimer was independently associated with OS and PFS in patients with endometrial cancer. The ΔD level was not related to the OS and PFS in endometrial cancer patients. The levels of D-dimer may be considered as an important predictor of PFS and OS in endometrial cancer patients treated with IMRT.
