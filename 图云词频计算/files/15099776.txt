abstract: Objectives:The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between the period of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and the prognosis of endometrial cancer.Methods:We reviewed 304 endometrial cancer patients who were diagnosed and treated between 1985 and 1998 in our hospital, and whose history of AUB and clinical parameters were clearly available from their charts. Pathological data and overall survival were compared between groups having different periods of AUB.Results:Duration of AUB had no impact on the prognosis of endometrial cancer. Patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer without AUB showed a significantly better 5-year overall survival rate than the patients diagnosed after the onset of AUB. The distribution of clinical stages and histological grades did not differ depending on AUB status.Conclusions:The prognosis of endometrial cancer was determined by the histopathological character of the tumor. However, the diagnosis and treatment of endometrial cancer with some suspicious signs other than AUB might improve the prognosis.
