abstract: Background:Thyroid function has been suggested to interfere with tumour biology and prognosis in different cancers. The present study was performed to investigate the impact of pre-therapeutic serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels on the prognosis of patients with endometrial cancer.Methods:Pre-therapeutic serum TSH was investigated in 199 patients with endometrial cancer. After stratification in TSH risk groups, univariate and multivariable survival analyses were performed.Results:Elevated TSH was independently associated with poor disease-specific survival in univariate/multivariable survival analyses (P=0.01 and P=0.03, respectively).Conclusion:Thyroid-stimulating hormone may serve as a novel and independent prognostic parameter for disease-specific survival in patients with endometrial cancer.
