from:W V Med J
time=1996 Jan-Feb
abstract: Endometrial cancer occurs more frequently than any other cancer of the female reproductive tract. The overall five-year survival rate for patients with endometrial carcinoma in a series of 13,000 patients was 68%. If diagnosed with Stage I disease, the patient's five-year survival increases to 75% (17). Early diagnosis of uterine cancer is accomplished by physician recognition of risk factors, symptoms and signs.
