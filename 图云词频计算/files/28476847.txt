abstract: Aim:To analyze the utility of HE4 assessment in preoperative management of patients with early-stage endometrial cancer for stratification into low-risk and high-risk groups.Patients and methods:The following data were prospectively collected from patients operated for endometrial cancer from 05/2012 till 9/2016; age, HE4, CA125, expert ultrasound examination of the pelvis, histotype, grade, FIGO stage.Results:In total, 124 patients were enrolled. A cut-off of â‰¥113 pmol/l HE4 demonstrated 40.3% sensitivity and 83.9% specificity for detection of high-risk patients. Correlations of HE4 with age (p&lt;0.001), depth of myometrial invasion (p=0.001), clinical stage of the disease according to ultrasound - T1a vs. T1b (63.6 pmol/l vs. 110.6 pmol/l, p&lt;0.001) were found. However, no correlation of HE4 with lymph node invasion (p=0.07) and tumor grade (p=0.212) was identified.Conclusion:HE4 levels correspond to clinical and FIGO stage of the disease. The sensitivity and specificity does not reach the transvaginal ultrasound results in preoperative assessment of the extent of the disease. Combination of HE4 with ultrasound does not improve the stratification of patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. Preoperative assessment of HE4 is useful providing no imaging method is available.
