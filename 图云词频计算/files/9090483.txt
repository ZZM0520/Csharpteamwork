abstract: The current literature on endometrial neoplasia deals with proliferative lesions such as endometrial proliferation in early pregnancy, atypical polypoid adenomyofibromata and their possible relationship to carcinoma, and histological grading of endometrial cancer with emphasis on nuclear grading and subtypes of endometrial cancer including the newly described intestinal and hepatoid types. Recent publications dealing with p53 protein, genetic studies, and nucleolar organizer regions are of interest but have provided no striking new insight into endometrial neoplasia. Angiogenesis has appeared for the first time in the literature in connection with endometrial neoplasia. Tamoxifen continues to occupy an important place in the literature, and endometrial adenosarcoma has been identified recently as one of the myriad of lesions which patients treated with tamoxifen are prone to develop.
