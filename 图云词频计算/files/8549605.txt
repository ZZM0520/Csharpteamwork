abstract: A solitary metastasis in the left tarsus led to the diagnosis of primary endometrial cancer in a 61 year-old patient with no history of postmenopausal bleeding. Lower leg amputation, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy were performed. Histopathology showed a well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus with a low mitotic rate, but infiltration of the outer third of the myometrium and lymph vessel invasion (FIGO Stage IVb). Immunostaining was positive for progesterone receptors, but negative for estrogen receptors and p53. The lymph nodes were free of metastases. Ascites was positive for malignant cells. Postoperatively the patient received carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and medroxyprogesterone acetate and is alive with no evidence of disease 10 months after diagnosis.
