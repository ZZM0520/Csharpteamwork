abstract: Objective:To determine the current status of postoperative management of endometrial cancer in Japan by surveying members of the Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG).Method:We conducted an original mail survey regarding the status of postoperative treatment including indication criteria, treatment procedures, and chemotherapeutic regimen among all 226 active member institutions of the JGOG.Results:A total of 199 institutions (88.1%) responded to the survey. A total of 4063 patients with endometrial cancer were treated at the member institutions of the JGOG over a year. As adjuvant therapy, chemotherapy (79.9%) was significantly (p&lt;0.01) preferred over radiotherapy (13.0%) or hormonal therapy (7.1%). Furthermore, more than 50% of respondent institutions performed adjuvant therapy when patients exhibited International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB/G3/positive lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI)/endometrioid adenocarcinoma or FIGO IB/G3/non-endometrioid histology, and more than 90% institutions administered adjuvant therapy when patients exhibited FIGO IC/G3/positive LVSI/endometrioid adenocarcinoma or FIGO stage IC/G3/regardless of LVSI/non-endometrioid histology. A combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin was the most preferred first-line regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy followed by combination regimens consisting of anthracycline and platinum.Conclusion:The present survey provides relevant information regarding the current status of adjuvant therapy in Japanese patients with endometrial cancer.
