abstract: Aim:To evaluate an association of adenomyosis with endometrial cancer and to determine the frequency of adenomyosis at hysterectomy specimens.Methods:This study was carried out retrospectively on pathologic specimens of hysterectomies. A total of 472 women in the period 2007-2011 enrolled to the study. All pathologies seen in hysterectomy specimens were noted. The frequency of adenomyosis and the accompanying pathologies were determined. These women were categorized into two groups according to the presence of adenomyosis. The incidence of adenomyosis was analyzed together with the endometrial cancer.Results:The incidence of adenomyosis was 20.8% at hysterectomy specimens. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean age of the two groups (p = 0.069). There were 98 cases with adenomyosis and the only pathologic finding was adenomyosis, in 28 (28.5%) cases. The most common accompanying pathologies with adenomyosis were uterine myomas in 51 (52%), uterine polyps in 16 (16.3%) and endometrial carcinomas in 11 (11.2%) cases. However, statistically significant association of the presence of adenomyosis with uterine myoma (p = 0.227) and endometrial polyps (p = 0.997) and endometrial carcinoma (p = 0.771) was not found.Conclusion:In hysterectomy specimens, no statistically significant difference was determined between the groups with and without adenomyosis in terms of co-occurrence with endometrial carcinoma.
