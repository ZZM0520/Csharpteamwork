abstract: Purpose:Endometrial carcinoma is the most prevalent gynecologic tumor in developed countries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the patients with endometrial cancer.Methods:Six hundred and seventy-four patients who had received postoperative therapy were retrospectively investigated. Of the cases, 186 were only monitored, whereas 43 received intracavitary radiotherapy (ICRT) and 54 external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Two hundred and fifty-nine patients received both EBRT plus ICRT. Eight patients received chemotherapy (CT), whereas 24 patients received both CT and EBRT plus ICRT.Results:Statistical analyses revealed that age, menopausal status, tumor histology, stage, grade, tumor diameter, myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion (LVI), positive cytology of abdominal fluid/washings, omental involvement, adnexal involvement and the type of the therapy significantly affected both the overall survival (OS) and disease- free survival (DFS). Survival was poor in patients over 60 years of age, who had advanced stage (higher than FIGO stage 2a), grade III tumor and myometrial invasion &gt;50%.Conclusion:Age was the most important factor associated with local relapse while survival was affected by age, grade, myometrial invasion and stage.
