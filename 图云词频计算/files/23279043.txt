abstract: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-producing nonhematopoietic malignancies have been reported in various organs, and most of them have been associated with poor clinical outcome. However, because of the rarity of reported cases, information regarding G-CSF-producing gynecological malignancies, especially uterine corpus cancer, is limited. We report a case of G-CSF-producing endometrial cancer, which exhibited a grave clinical outcome. Our case strongly indicates the aggressive nature of G-CSF-producing endometrial cancer.
