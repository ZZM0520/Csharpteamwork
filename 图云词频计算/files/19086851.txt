abstract: Background:Endometrial carcinoma is the most common cancer of the lower female genital tract in the USA. Various factors, including age, body mass index, race, disease stage, diabetes, histology, tumor grade and other comorbid conditions were associated with endometrial carcinoma mortality in previous case-control and cross-sectional studies not involving tumor registries. Cancer registries are important sources of data on endometrial cancer; however, they are rarely utilized in current research projects. The purpose of this study was to analyze factors associated with endometrial cancer mortality in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Magee Cancer Registry (PA, USA).Methods:Data were obtained from the UPMC cancer registry from 1996 to 2007. A total of 1614 cases were identified using the Honest Broker system at Magee Womens Hospital. Key factors involved in endometrial cancer mortality were identified through survival analysis.Results:Among the characteristics available from the cancer registry, the following were the main ones associated with endometrial cancer mortality: race, stage, chemotherapy, parity and lymph node involvement.Conclusions:This is one of the first studies that reported factors influencing endometrial cancer mortality in patients residing in Pittsburgh area. An improved understanding of risk factors associated with endometrial cancer morbidity and mortality may hold a key to better preventive strategies for endometrial carcinoma, especially for women in high-risk groups.
