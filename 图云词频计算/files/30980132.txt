abstract: Objectives:Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) is a treatment strategy for ovarian cancer patients with unresectable disease or poor performance status (PS). This strategy has been used in the treatment of advanced endometrial cancer and a survival benefit has been shown in patients who are subsequently able to undergo interval cytoreduction. This study sought to review our single institution experience with NACT for advanced endometrial cancer.Methods:We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who received NACT for advanced endometrial cancer at two institutions in New York City between 2002 and 2016.Results:We identified 39 patients (median age 61, range 35-89). The histologic subtype distribution was: serous (44%), endometrioid (28%), carcinosarcoma (10%), clear cell (8%), mixed (8%), neuroendocrine (3%). Contraindications to primary surgery included: unresectable disease (72%), poor PS (15%), unresectable disease and poor PS (13%). Twenty-three patients (59%) did not undergo IDS due to: progression of disease (70%), medical ineligibility (4%), unresectable disease (17%), lost to follow-up (4%), death (4%). Sixteen patients (41%) underwent IDS, 81% had an optimal cytoreduction. Disease status at NACT completion was: partial response (56%), stable disease (3%) and progression of disease (41%). There were no complete responses. Patients who responded to NACT had a significantly longer overall survival than those who did not (15 vs. 5 months. P = 0.015). IDS was also associated with an improvement in overall survival versus no surgery (16 vs. 6 months, P = 0.04).Conclusions:Unlike ovarian cancer, less than half of the patients undergoing NACT for endometrial cancer underwent IDS, none had a complete response, and 41% had disease progression during NACT. However, endometrial cancer patients who underwent IDS had a high rate of optimal cytoreduction. Both response to NACT and IDS were associated with improved survival.
