abstract: Background:The optimal adjuvant treatment for stage III endometrial cancer in the era of modern radiotherapy remains undefined. We investigated the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy for women who underwent optimal resection for stage III endometrial cancer in the era of modern radiotherapy.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed patients with endometrial cancer who were treated between 2010 and 2018. Adjuvant treatment included radiotherapy by modern radiotherapy techniques (intensity-modulated or volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy), chemotherapy, or both. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed via multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.Results:One hundred sixty-one patients were initially included (52, 9, and 100 with stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC cancer, respectively); 154 patients (96%) received adjuvant therapy. Such adjuvant treatment was associated with improved RFS (p = 0.014) and OS (p = 0.044) over surgery alone. Adjuvant radiotherapy by modern radiotherapy techniques led to low incidence of acute (25%) and chronic (7%) grade ≥ 2 gastrointestinal toxicity. On univariate analysis, non-endometrioid histology and grade 3 status were associated with higher risks of tumor recurrence and death, whereas adjuvant radiotherapy alone or in combination chemotherapy reduced their risks. On multivariate analysis, non-endometrioid histology was associated with increased recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 2.95; p = 0.009), whereas adjuvant radiotherapy alone or with chemotherapy was associated with lower recurrence (HR, 0.62; p = 0.042). Patients &gt; 60 years of age (p = 0.038) as well as those with endometrioid histology (p = 0.045), lymphovascular space invasion (p = 0.031), and ≥ 2 positive lymph nodes (p = 0.044) benefited most from adjuvant radiotherapy.Conclusions:Modern adjuvant radiotherapy (intensity-modulated or volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy) alone or with chemotherapy should be considered for women with optimally resected stage III endometrial cancer.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04251676" title="See in ClinicalTrials.gov">NCT04251676</a>.
