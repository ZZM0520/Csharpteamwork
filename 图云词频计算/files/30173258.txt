abstract: The prevalence of endometrial cancer among asymptomatic women is rather reduced also due to the absence of a cost-efficient test, as there are no ideal screening examinations for endometrial cancer. Several methods were proposed in medical practice to discover endometrial neoplasia at an early stage, among which: endometrial biopsy, endovaginal ultrasound, targeted biopsy hysteroscopy. This study was made on a group of 38 patients monitored for metrorrhagia in the interval between July 1, 2014-July 1, 2016. All patients were monitored clinically and by ultrasound, endometrium samples were taken by biopsied uterine curettage, and a histopathological examination was performed, completed by immunomarking, whenever necessary. The clinical and paraclinical methods allowed for the creation of a protocol by which patients were monitored. This protocol allowed for the modulation and effectiveness of the treatment, establishing the best therapeutic conduct and the remote supervision.
