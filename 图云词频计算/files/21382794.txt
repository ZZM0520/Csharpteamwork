abstract: Lymph node status is a major prognostic element in endometrial cancer and affects the choice of adjuvant therapy. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure is proposed as an alternative to lymphadenectomy. This review aims to assess its feasibility. To this end, 19 studies have been analysed. It appears that double detection (colorimetric and isotopic) is better than single detection, independent of injection site. Hysteroscopic injection is technically more difficult, yet can be done near the tumoral lesion. The cervical site does not accurately reflect the lymphatic drainage of the uterine body but is easier to access. SLN detection rate is notably identical between these two injections sites. Lomboaortic detection rate is lower for cervical injections than for endometrial ones. The myometrial site is also difficult to access (intraoperatively), due to same limitations as the hysteroscopic route, and can be deceiving (insufficient detection rate and high false-negative rate). The SLN allows for ultrastadification (micrometastases and isolated tumoral cells) with the development of new pathological techniques (serial sections and immunohistochemistry). Data on SLN in endometrial cancer is very heterogeneous in terms of methodology and populations studied. Despite being well-known, the SLN procedure in endometrial cancer remains in its feasibility stage. Its place in therapeutic strategies needs to be further explored and its potential benefit remains to be confirmed.
