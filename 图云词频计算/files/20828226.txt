abstract: Importance of the field:Endometrial cancer remains the most common gynecologic malignancy. The treatment of endometrial cancer is rapidly evolving.Areas covered in this review:In this article, we aim to review current and future treatment options in the medical treatment of endometrial cancers.What the reader will gain:The cornerstone of curative therapy for patients with endometrial cancer is surgical treatment. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is the mainstay of therapy for metastatic and advanced endometrial cancer. The most active chemotherapy agents are anthracyclines, platinum compounds and taxanes. Combination chemotherapy has produced higher response rates than single agent therapy. Cisplatin and doxorubicin combination chemotherapy has served as the control arm in many trials. Three-drug combination regimen has shown the highest response rate but with increased toxicity. Despite the lack of published data supporting the superiority of the paclitaxel plus carboplatin combination over doxorubicin and cisplatin, many centers prefer this regimen as a standard of care. Hormonal therapy should be considered in patients with low grade tumors and in those with a poor performance status. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of endometrial cancer have led to development of targeted therapies. Among these the more promising ones are mTOR inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents.Take home message:Clinical trials are planned to further explore how to best incorporate novel agents into the current treatment algorithm with the aim to improve outcome for women with endometrial adenocarcinomas.
