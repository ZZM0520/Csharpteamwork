title=Stage IV endometrial carcinoma: a 10 year review of patients.
from:Br J Radiol
time=1999 May
abstract: Stage IV endometrial cancer is uncommon, often occurs in elderly patients and has a poor prognosis, which makes the choice of treatment difficult. 18 patients with stage IV endometrial cancer presenting over a 10 year period, between 1987 and 1997, were reviewed with regard to mode of treatment and response. The mean age was 65 years. Five had disease confined to the pelvis and 13 had extra pelvic disease. 15 of 18 patients had a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). One patient received radiotherapy alone and five received post-operative radiotherapy. Overall freedom from pelvic symptoms was achieved in seven of 18 patients. All seven had undergone TAH and two had received post-operative radiotherapy. Progestogens were given to 13 patients. Six received progestogens alone, without radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Of these, two responded, one for 9 months and one with verified lung metastases, who had a complete response, is still alive at 6.5 years. Eight patients received chemotherapy, with single agent cisplatin or carboplatin AUC 6. Three patients responded, one for 4.5 years. The overall median survival was 12 months from diagnosis. Actuarial 5 year survival was 15% (CI 3-36). There was no significant survival difference for, hormone therapy or chemotherapy. Stage IV endometrial cancer has a poor prognosis but durable response can be achieved in some patients.
