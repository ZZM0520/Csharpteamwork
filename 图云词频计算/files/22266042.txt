abstract: Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic role of systematic retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy in patients with endometrial cancer.Methods:From December 2003 to December 2008, 349 eligible patients who underwent surgical staging procedures at primary treatment were retrospectively analyzed: systematic lymphadenectomy group (n = 246) and no-lymphadenectomy group (n = 103). Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model.Results:Overall, patients who underwent lymphadenectomy improved 5-year disease-free survival (89.0% versus 80.7%, P = 0.019) and overall survival (92.8% versus 81.5%, P = 0.001) compared to those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy. Overall survival was not related to lymphadenectomy in 212 low-risk patients (93.1% versus 84.6%, P = 0.176). However, this association was found in 137 patients with intermediate and high-risk (86.2% versus 73.3%, P = 0.021). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that FIGO stage (P = 0.037) and lymphadenectomy (P = 0.023) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival.Conclusions:Systematic retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy has a potentially therapeutic role on survival in surgically staged patients with endometrial cancer.
