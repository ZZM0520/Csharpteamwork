abstract: The most common gynecological malignancy, the endometrial carcinoma, is mostly diagnosed at early stages. However, diagnosis at advanced stages is accompanied by the high mortality rate. It is suggested that this cancer is one of the less studied female cancers. The necessity to establish novel diagnostic markers has led to investigations of small non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs, also in endometrial cancer. There have been found many microRNAs potentially associated with carcinogenesis and clinico-pathological data including prognosis for patients. Many microRNAs may also serve as diagnostic markers for non-invasive diagnostics using blood plasma. We reviewed extensively the published research focused on microRNAs that have been found deregulated particularly in tissue samples within the both major types of endometrial cancer (type 1 and type 2). They are presented in the view of their potential targets and mechanisms of action. Some microRNAs have been found deregulated also in blood plasma. There exists a high level of inconsistency across the studies as many microRNAs have been found only within one or a few studies so far. However, there are some microRNAs consistently deregulated as suggested several investigations. There remains the urgent need of more intensive research focused on the microRNAs and their regulatory role in endometrial cancer. Such a research should provide the basis for the introducing novel diagnostic tools into the clinical practice.
