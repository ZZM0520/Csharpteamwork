abstract: We evaluated the level of angiogenesis in endometrial adenocarcinoma and investigated the relationship between tumor vascularity and clinicopathological parameters. The level of angiogenesis in noninvaded uterine smooth muscle was also studied. Angiogenesis was studied in uteri of 29 post-menopausal women operated on for endometrial cancer. DAKO EPOS Anti-Human von Willebrand Factor/HRP antibodies were applied to mark endothelial cells. Both vessels and endothelial cells were counted on a light microscope equipped with computerized morphometric appliance. The highest density of vessels and endothelial cells was found in disease-free uterine smooth muscle tissue situated distant to the tumor. Density of vessels and endothelial cell counts were higher in the outer as compared to the central parts of the tumor. We found statistically significant differences in total angiogenic points' density between groups of various clinical FIGO staging, specifically between Ia and Ib, Ic, II. A positive correlation was found between the clinical stage of the disease (according to FIGO) and the total angiogenic points' density, density of endothelial cells and the density of vessels with viable lumen (counts/sq. mm calculated from the central parts of the tumor). These results suggest that the analysis of angiogenesis may be a useful biologic parameter and additional study of neovascularization in endometrial cancer is warranted.
