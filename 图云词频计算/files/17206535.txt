abstract: Objectives:To (1) determine the nature of the association between physical activity and endometrial cancer risk; (2) assess the contribution of variation in the quality of physical activity measurement to inconsistencies in study results; and (3) review the biologic mechanisms that might mediate possible effects of physical activity on risk.Methods:We reviewed and summarized all published epidemiologic studies examining physical activity and endometrial cancer risk, and evidence relating to possible biologic mechanisms. We assigned each study a quality score for physical activity measurement.Results:Fourteen of the 18 studies showed a convincing or possible protective effect of physical activity on endometrial cancer risk, with an average relative risk reduction of around 30%. A dose-response relation was observed in 7 of 13 studies. The quality score was not related to the observed strength of association or the presence of a dose-response relation. There was epidemiologic and biologic evidence that vigorous activity, as well as light and moderate intensity activities, such as housework, gardening or walking for transportation, may reduce risk.Conclusions:Physical activity probably has a protective role in endometrial cancer development. More epidemiologic and biologic evidence is needed to make conclusive recommendations on optimal types, characteristics or time periods of physical activity.
