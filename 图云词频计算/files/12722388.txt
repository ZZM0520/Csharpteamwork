abstract: Objectives:Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy. The purpose of the study was to compare the reliability of different methods for diagnosing endometrial cancer.Design:A prospective study from January 1996 to September 1998.Materials and methods:264 women at risk of endometrial cancer with clinical indications for hysteroscopy with curettage participated in the study. They underwent different diagnostic methods: endometrial cytology (121 cases), endometrial biopsy (150) or ultrasonography (200). The accuracy of these methods was related to the following results obtained from hysteroscopy with curettage.Results:The results of the study suggest higher reliability of endometrial biopsy from cytology. The hysteroscopic diagnosis conforms with the histologic examination showed by the curettage. Endometrial cancer as the cause of post-menopausal bleeding can be excluded in cases with endometrial thickness of &lt; or = 5 mm measured by vaginal ultrasonography.Conclusions:We concluded that the combination of hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy may substitute for curettage and become the method of choice for the endometrium.
