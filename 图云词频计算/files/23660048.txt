abstract: Objective:To review the evidence relating to the use of adjuvant therapy after surgical treatment for endometrial cancer.Options:Women with endometrial cancer can be given the option of receiving adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy according to pathologic findings at time of surgery.Outcomes:The outcomes measured are postoperative progression-free and overall survival in endometrial cancer patients.Evidence:Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library, using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., endometrial neoplasms) and key words (e.g., endometrium cancer, endometrial carcinoma). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to December 31, 2011. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, national and international medical specialty societies, and recent conference abstracts.Values:The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table).Benefits, harms, and costs:This guideline is intended to help standardize postoperative treatment of endometrial cancer and minimize undertreatment and overtreatment.Validation:The guideline was reviewed for accuracy by content experts in pathology, radiation oncology, and medical oncology. Guideline content was also compared with relevant documents from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
