abstract: Aim:The aim of the study was to investigate if VEGF levels reflect the severity of endometrial cancer and the clinic relationship between microvasal density (MVD) and concentration of VEGF in tumor.Methods:The study was conducted on 22 patients affected by endometrial cancer who were submitted to total abdominal radical hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-ophorectomy. VEGF (pg/mL) and MVD values were measured on histologic specimens of endometrial cancer obtained during the surgical treatment. The means and standard deviations of estimated values were calculated and a statistical comparison was effected by student t test for not coupled data. Pearson correlation test was used to analyze the eventual correlation among VEGF and MVD values in overall patients.Results:We have documented that VEGF expression and MVD change according to FIGO stage, lympho-vascular infiltration and lymph node involvement. Pearson correlation test shows a good linear positive correlation in overall patients between VEGF and MVD values.Conclusions:Results obtained show a possible use of VEGF as prognostic factor in endometrial cancer. Confirmation of these data may permit both to identify high-risk patients, who must be treated with a more aggressive treatment, and to use an angiogenic therapy in endometrial cancer.
