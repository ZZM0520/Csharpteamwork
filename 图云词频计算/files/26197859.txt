abstract: To improve survival in women with endometrial cancer, we need to look at the "big picture" beyond initial treatment. Although the majority of women will be diagnosed with early stage disease and are cured with surgery alone, there is a subgroup of women with advanced and high-risk early stage disease whose life expectancy may be prolonged with the addition of chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry will help to identify those women with Lynch syndrome who will benefit from more frequent colorectal cancer surveillance and genetic counseling. If they happen to be diagnosed with colorectal cancer, this information has an important therapeutic implication. And finally, because the majority of women will survive their diagnosis of endometrial cancer, they remain at risk for breast and colorectal cancer, so these women should be counselled about screening for these cancers. These three interventions will contribute to improving the overall survival of women with endometrial cancer.
