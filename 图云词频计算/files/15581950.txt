abstract: Objective:The current study was undertaken to determine if DNA ploidy is a useful prognostic variable for predicting recurrence in stage I endometrial cancer. For cancer of the endometrium, survival following recurrence may depend on a number of factors, including the pattern of recurrence and the response to second line treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated a worse survival for patients with DNA aneuploid tumors. It remains unclear, however, whether this is necessarily due to a higher risk of recurrence. This study was undertaken to assess DNA ploidy and risk of recurrence in patients with stage I endometrial cancer.Methods:This is a retrospective study of surgically treated patients with stages IB and IC endometrial cancer treated from 1992 to 2000. All patients underwent definitive surgery, including staging lymphadenectomy. None of the patients received postoperative treatment. DNA ploidy was determined using flow cytometry and image analysis. Grade, lymph-vascular space invasion, stage (stage IB versus IC), and DNA ploidy were analyzed with regard to recurrence and survival.Results:There were 100 patients with stages IB and IC endometrial cancer in this analysis. There were 17 recurrences (17%) and 10 patients that died of cancer (10%). Grade 3 and the presence of lymph-vascular space invasion were associated with increased risk of recurrence; DNA aneuploidy and stage were not. Grade, lymph-vascular space invasion, and DNA ploidy were associated with survival. These findings indicate that DNA aneuploidy does not increase the risk of disease recurrence but is associated with overall survival.Conclusion:Although the recurrence risk is not higher for patients with surgical stage I endometrial cancer and aneuploid tumors, overall mortality remains higher.
