abstract: The authors made an investigation of patients suffering from endometrial cancer during a one year period in Hungary. Out of the data of 105 gynecological wards from the 1051 patients 1043 cases were evaluated. Staging was controlled having the histological results and the clinical data on every sheet, fitting the requirements of the latest international classification, and taking into account the grading of histological differentiation. They evaluated the place and the way of diagnosis and the distribution of the methods leading to definitive diagnosis. The different examinations to state a definitive diagnosis were reported. Distributions of age and stages were compared with the published Hungarian cases. Actual situation of management was criticized, studying the present possibilities of operative, irradiative and chemical treatment. They suggest more particular determination of staging and grading of patients suffering from endometrial cancer in order to provide uniform treatment that fits the international requirements.
