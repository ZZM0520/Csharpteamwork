abstract: Endometrial cancer (EC) therapy is characterized by the heterogeneity of EC subtypes resulting in unclear clinical behavior as well as in unsatisfactory treatment options. The available biomarkers, such as cellular tumor antigen p53 (TP53), phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase and dual-specificity protein phosphatase (PTEN), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) genes alone might not be sufficient, and thus, new predictive and prognostic biomarkers are urgently required. The biomolecule class of microRNA represents a group of endogenously expressed regulatory factors primarily involved in control of pivotal cancer-related mechanisms including cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. Here, we review the current state of science regarding microRNA functionality in EC progression.
