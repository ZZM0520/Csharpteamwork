abstract: Background:Some studies have been realized to know the concordance level between the preoperative and the diagnosis of endometrial cancer and it has been observed that there is a tendency to undergrade the stage of cancer in preoperative studies.Methods:It was carried out an observational, retrolective, transversal and comparative study to establish the concordance between the preoperative and the definitive study in endometrial cancer. We revised the records of the Pathology department of the Hospital "Luis Castelazo Ayala" from January 1st, 2012, to December 31th, 2014. The concordance was calculated by using the Cohen's kappa coefficient and the force scale of concordance proposed by Byrt, and the test of comparison of two proportions.Results:We observed a low concordance between the preoperative and the definitive study regarding the histologic variety (kappa = 0.258, p = 0.000) and the degree of differentiation (kappa = 0.220, p = 0.001). These differences were statistically significant for the moderate grade degree of differentiation (Z = -3.409, p &lt; 0.05).Conclusion:There is a low level of concordance between the preoperative and the definitive study in the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.
