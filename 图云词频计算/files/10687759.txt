abstract: Cancer of the uterine corpus, commonly referred to as cancer of the endometrium or cancer of the uterus, continues to be the most common pelvic genital malignancy affecting western women (1). In 1998 in the United States 36,100 women were diagnosed with this cancer, and there were 6,300 deaths from this condition in that year. Of concern is that despite a relatively stable incidence over the last decade, the annual number of deaths since 1987 from endometrial cancer has more than doubled (2). Many controversies exist in the management of apparent early endometrial cancer. These include: 1. The role of surgical staging which includes pelvic lymphadenectomy. 2. The role of the subspecialist gynaecological oncologist in primary surgical treatment. 3. Indications for vaginal and external beam radiotherapy. 4. Who is at risk for recurrence? 5. The role of laparoscopic approach to the management of this disease. Despite their importance, these and other issues have not been appropriately addressed by prospective randomized studies. Treatment strategies and algorithms have thus been based upon a combination of clinicopathological studies and uncontrolled reviews. The views expressed in this clinical opinion are those of the Sydney Gynaecologic Oncology Group and reflect our philosophy on the current management of this tumour, supported by recent and appropriate peer reviewed scientific literature.
