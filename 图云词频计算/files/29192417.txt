abstract: Although hysteroscopy is currently the undisputed gold standard for the examination of the uterine cavity in women with suspected endometrial cancer, it remains controversial as a procedure that can enhance metastasis spread. Endometrial cancer cells may shed during hysteroscopy and be passively transported with fluid flow into the peritoneal cavity. The paper presents the review of current knowledge regarding the risk of neoplasm metastases in women who had diagnostic hysteroscopy and the conditions that have to be met for the procedure to be safe. We searched PubMed, Ovid, Medline and Scopus databases for data published in the years 1985-2017. The following browsing criteria, the "MeSH headings": hysteroscopy, endometrial cancer, intraperitoneal or metastatic spread were used to find relevant papers. Based on the current data analysis we conclude that (1.) diagnostic hysteroscopy performed in women with endometrial cancer, especially in its early stages, is a very useful, efficient and safe diagnostic method and (2.) the distension media used for endoscopic procedures in the uterine cavity must be strictly controlled for relatively low pressures to prevent the increase in risk of endometrial cancer intraperitoneal spread.
