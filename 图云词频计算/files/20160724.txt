abstract: Background:To analyse the correlation between pre-treatment plasma fibrinogen levels and clinical-pathological parameters in patients with endometrial cancer and to assess the value of plasma fibrinogen as a prognostic parameter.Methods:Within a retrospective multi-centre study, the records of 436 patients with endometrial cancer were reviewed and pre-treatment plasma fibrinogen levels were correlated with clinical-pathological parameters and patients' survival.Results:The mean (s.d.) pre-treatment plasma fibrinogen level was 388.9 (102.4) mg per 100 ml. Higher plasma fibrinogen levels were associated with advanced tumour stage (FIGO I vs II vs III and IV, P=0.002), unfavourable histological subtype (endometrioid vs non-endometrioid histology, P=0.03), and higher patients' age (&lt; or =67 years vs &gt;67 years, P=0.04), but not with higher histological grade (G1 vs G2 vs G3, P=0.2). In a multivariate analysis, tumour stage (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.001), histological grade (P=0.009 and P=0.002), patients' age (P=0.001 and P&lt;0.001), and pre-treatment plasma fibrinogen levels (P=0.04 and P=0.02) were associated with disease-free and overall survival, respectively.Conclusion:Plasma fibrinogen levels can be used as an independent prognostic parameter for the disease-free and overall survival of patients with endometrial cancer.
