abstract: In a case-control-study an epidemiological investigation of cancer of the endometrium was carried out. The study included 159 cases and 159 controls. It was shown, that woman in the sixth life decade with overweight, a smaller number of deliveries and a later menopause had a higher risk for endometrial cancer. Other risk factors are diabetes mellitus and hypertension. But it is necessary to see the relationship between the typical age for these two characteristics and the typical age for endometrial cancer. The intake of estrogens without enough gestagens during an estrogen replacement therapy was associated with an increased risk. Furthermore the patients with carcinoma of the uterine corpus had a higher incidence of malignant tumors in their families and more breast cancer in their own case history. A history of oral contraceptive use appeared to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. In addition there is an negative association between smoking and endometrial cancer. Thus factors of high risk related to cancer of the endometrium could be defined. Preventive examinations of high risk groups could help to decrease the incidence of endometrial cancer.
