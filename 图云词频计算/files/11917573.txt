abstract: Objective:To investigate the effectiveness of mass screening for endometrial cancer using Endocyte (Laboratoire CCD, Paris, France) endometrial smears.Study design:The study subjects were consecutive patients with documented endometrial cancer diagnosed between January 1, 1989, and December 31, 1997, at 22 hospitals in Japan. One hundred twenty-six cases were detected by mass screening and 1,069 diagnosed in outpatient clinics. We compared the stage of cancer at diagnosis and survival rate of patients in the two groups.Results:Early stage was significantly more frequent in the screening group (P &lt; .001); stage I comprised 88.1% of the screening group as compared with 65.3% of the outpatient group. Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma was significantly more frequent in the screening group (P &lt; .01); grade 1 constituted 74.7% of the screening group as compared with 61.0% of the outpatient group. The five-year survival rate was significantly higher in the screening group than in the outpatient group (94.0% vs. 84.3%, P = .041). The crude hazard ratio (HR) of dying of endometrial cancer for the screening group as compared to the outpatient group was .47 (95% CI .22-.99, P = .048). HR became .96 (95% CI .45-2.08, P = .925) after adjustment for age, study area and cancer stage.Conclusion:The results suggest that an endometrial cancer screening program would lead to early detection and improved survival among women with endometrial cancer.
