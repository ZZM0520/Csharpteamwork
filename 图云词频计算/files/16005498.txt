abstract: Objective:To evaluate the outcomes of patients with node-negative stage II endometrial cancer who received vault brachytherapy without external beam pelvic radiotherapy (EBRT).Methods:A retrospective review of all stage II endometrioid type endometrial cancer patients referred to Cancer Care Manitoba was undertaken between October 1995 and March 2001. Forty-nine patients were identified with disease confined to the uterus, but not all patients received extended surgical staging (ESS) with pelvic lymphadenectomy. These patients were evaluated for recurrence and morbidity data.Results:Twenty node-negative stage II cancers were identified. Three were treated without adjuvant treatment, 12 received vault brachytherapy and 5 received more conventional treatment with EBRT and vault brachytherapy. No recurrences or deaths occurred in these patients. Mean follow-up was 40 months. No surgical complications were encountered in this group and no morbidity from radiotherapy was observed.Conclusions:Limiting adjuvant treatment to vault brachytherapy for node-negative stage II endometrial cancer results in less morbidity and excellent survival and is worthy of further investigation.
