abstract: Objectives:The purpose of the study was assessing prognostic value of AgNORs expression in endometrial cancer.Materials and methods:The study was performed in a group of 90 patients, diagnosed with endometrial cancer, treated in Clinic of Gynecological Oncology in Wroc≈Çaw. Silver nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs) were stained in paraffin-embedded samples, using Ploton method modified by Oefner.Results:The mean number of AgNORs was 2.76 +/- 0.46. To assess the possible influence of AgNORs expression, patients were divided into three groups, based on the mean number of AgNORs: I- &lt;2.3; II- 2.3-3; III- &gt;3. The differences in the outcome between these groups were not significantly different. The mean number of AgNORs in the group of patients with distant metastases and progression did not differ (2.72). The highest mean number of AgNORs (3.38) was observed in patients with local failure.Conclusions:At this point in time, there is inadequate evidence to use AgNORs as predictive factors in patients with endometrial cancer further studies are warranted.
