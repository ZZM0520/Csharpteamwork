abstract: Objectives:To describe the gray-scale and vascular characteristics of endometrial cancer in relation to stage, grade and size using two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) transvaginal ultrasound.Methods:This was a prospective multicenter study including 144 women with endometrial cancer undergoing transvaginal ultrasound before surgery. The sonographic characteristics assessed were echogenicity, endometrial/myometrial border, fibroids, vascular pattern, color score and tumor/uterus anteroposterior (AP) ratio. Histological assessment of tumor stage, grade, type and growth pattern was performed.Results:Hyperechoic or isoechoic tumors were more often seen in Stage IA cancer, whereas mixed or hypoechoic tumors were more often found in cancers of Stage IB or greater (P = 0.003). Hyperechogenicity was more common in Grade 1-2 tumors (i.e. well or moderately differentiated) (P = 0.02) and in tumors with a tumor/uterine AP ratio of &lt; 50% (P = 0.002), whereas a non-hyperechoic appearance was more commonly found in Grade 3 tumors (i.e. poorly differentiated) and in tumors with a tumor/uterine AP ratio of ≥ 50%. Multiple global vessels were more often seen in tumors of Stage IB or greater than in Stage IA tumors (P = 0.02), in Grade 3 tumors than in Grade 1 and 2 tumors (P = 0.02) and in tumors with a tumor/uterine AP ratio of ≥ 50% (P &lt; 0.001). A moderate/high color score was significantly more common in tumors of higher stage (P = 0.03) and larger size (P = 0.001).Conclusion:The sonographic appearance of endometrial cancer is significantly associated with tumor stage, grade and size. More advanced tumors often have a mixed/hypoechoic echogenicity, a higher color score and multiple globally entering vessels, whereas less advanced tumors are more often hyperechoic and have no or a low color score.
