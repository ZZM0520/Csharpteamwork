abstract: An inflammation expressed in a moderate degree and hav- ing a chronic character is associated with the local changes in the tumor and adipose tissue (manifested, in particular, by lym- phocytic and macrophage infiltration) as well as with systemic shifts involving hormone and hormone-like elements for their implementation. The unfavorable consequences of these shifts may be restrained due to the endogenous anti-inflammatory re- serves (systems) and intentionally used exogenous agents with the same action. These issues are considered on the example of endometrial cancer, for the occurrence and course of which a considerable significance is attributed to the excess of body fat, especially in its &lt;&lt;standard&gt;&gt;, rather than &lt;&lt;metabolically healthy&gt;&gt; variant. The importance of analysis of discussed factors is ad- ditionally enhanced due to the changes in understanding of the nature of endometrial cancer and contemporary breakaway from the dualistic principle of its division into separate types.
