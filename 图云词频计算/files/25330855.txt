abstract: Introduction:From the dualistic classification that divides endometrial cancer (EC) into two types with distinct underlying molecular profiling, histopathology and clinical behavior, arises a deeper understanding of the carcinogenesis pathways. EC treatment comprises different and multimodal therapeutic approaches, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy or combinations of novel drugs; however, few of these regimens have truly improved progression-free or survival rates in advanced and metastatic settings.Areas covered:We reviewed the main molecular pathways involved in EC carcinogenesis through a wide literature search of novel compounds that alone or in combination with traditional drugs have been investigated or are currently under investigation in randomized clinical trials.Expert opinion:The molecular therapies mainly discussed in this review are potential therapeutic candidates for more effective and specific treatments. In the genomic era, a deeper knowledge about molecular characteristics of cancer provides the hope for the development of better therapeutic approaches. Targeting both genetic and epigenetic alterations, attacking tumor cells using cell-surface markers overexpressed in tumor tissue, reactivating antitumor immune responses and identifying predictive biomarkers represent the emerging strategies and the major challenges.
