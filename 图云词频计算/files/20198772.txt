abstract: Aim:Our aim was to evaluate the effect of HRT on endometrial cancer patientsMaterial and methods:We applied HRT in 250 patients-locally (cream) and in 300 patients in other routes and doses-tablet form, estradermal form, implant form. The research and the follow up were done for 10 years period.Results:When we applied unopposed estrogen (0.3 mg) we had 5 fold increase in the risk of endometrial cancer. The application of local cream with low doses estrogen did not increase the risk of endometrial proliferation and the development of endometrial cancer. The addition of progestogens for 10-14 days led the patients to lower risk of endometrial cancer development. Applying Tibolone lowered the risk of endometrial cancer and had a protective effect on the endometrium.Conclusions:The application of progestogens for 10-14 days reduced the risk for endometrial cancer and had a protective effect on the endometrium. The HRT was mostly applied in early endometrial cancer grade 1,2.
