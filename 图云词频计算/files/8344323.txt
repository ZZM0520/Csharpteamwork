abstract: The dynamics of the cellular immunity indices have been studied in 81 patients with endometrial cancer, during the period of combined surgery and post-operative gamma-therapy and also during short-wave therapy. The results obtained testify to the immunostimulating and immunomodulating effect of electromagnetic irradiation of short-wave frequency, thus providing rehabilitation of the immune system in endometrial cancer patients and serving as the basis for short-wave therapy, including it in the complex of therapies given to this group of patients.
